1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
All right, so today we're taking a deep dive into something called UniInfo.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,720
UniInfo.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,240
For UniInfo as it's actually spelled.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,240
Yeah.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,880
And, you know, when I first came across this, I thought, this is like some kind of sci-fi

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,880
thing.

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,880
Right.

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,240
But it turns out it's a whole framework for thinking about information, like a whole

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,440
new way of looking at how knowledge works.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,840
Yeah, it's a different approach.

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,480
And we've got all these notes and brainstorms and stuff, and so if it gets a little technical,

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,720
you know, with references to web development or philosophy.

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,160
That's a lot of different areas.

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,480
Yeah, and that's why we've got, you know, expert speaker here to help us kind of connect

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,480
the dots.

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,480
Yeah, definitely happy to be here.

17
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,480
Yeah.

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,000
And it is interesting because one of the things about UniInfo is that it's presented

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,800
as a knowledge graph.

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
A knowledge graph, huh?

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Yeah.

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
Is that so?

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,120
So it's sort of like, if you imagine a giant web, but instead of, like, you know, spider

24
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,000
webs, it's woven with ideas.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,200
So each concept is like a node in this web.

27
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,480
And then the connections between them show how these ideas relate to each other.

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,480
Okay.

29
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,480
So it's not just about the information itself.

30
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,480
It's about the relationships.

31
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
Gotcha.

32
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,480
So it's not just like a list of facts about like seeing how it all.

33
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
Exactly.

34
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,960
Seeing the bigger picture, how everything kind of fits together.

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
Okay.

36
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
I like that.

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
Yeah.

38
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,760
And that kind of leads into this idea of the mind jungle, which is like a metaphor.

39
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
Okay.

40
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,760
The mind jungle.

41
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,760
Yeah.

42
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
I like it already.

43
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,200
How all of our thoughts and ideas and concepts kind of come together to form our understanding

44
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
of the world?

45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Okay.

46
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,720
I'm starting to see like the jungle imagery here.

47
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
Right.

48
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,320
But what kind of like trees grow in this mind jungle?

49
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,920
So some of the ideas that they talk about in these notes are actually very abstract concepts.

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,920
You're okay.

51
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,160
Like, for example, there's a whole discussion on substance and essence.

52
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
Substance and essence.

53
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
Yeah.

54
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
Sounds kind of philosophical.

55
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,600
Well, it is, but it's also very practical.

56
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Okay.

57
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,520
So about it, like everything has a physical form, right?

58
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,920
And then it also has a deeper meaning.

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
Sure.

60
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,880
So if you take a share, for example, the chair has its substance, which is like the, what,

61
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,200
the fabric, the screws that hold it together.

62
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Yeah.

63
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,160
But then it also has this essence, which is like the idea of a chair, what it's used for.

64
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,160
Yeah.

65
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
Its purpose.

66
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
Its design, right?

67
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
Right, right.

68
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,680
So in union, this kind of relates to the idea that content has both like this tangible

69
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,520
form and a deeper meaning.

70
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,120
So substance is like what we can touch and see.

71
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
Right.

72
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Essence is the idea behind it.

73
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
Exactly.

74
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Gotcha.

75
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,040
And just like in the real world, information in Euninkpo has both of these things.

76
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
Interesting.

77
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,280
And there's also this distinction that they make between intent and extent.

78
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
Intent and extent.

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
Yeah.

80
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Okay.

81
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
Now you've got me really curious.

82
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,480
So intent refers to like the purpose behind information.

83
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,800
Like, why does it exist?

84
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,520
What message is it trying to convey?

85
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
Uh-huh.

86
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,640
Whereas, extent is more about the reach and impact of that information.

87
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,320
So how far it spreads, who it influences that kind of thing?

88
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
Exactly.

89
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
Like how far does it go?

90
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
Who does it affect?

91
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,320
Okay.

92
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,200
So intent is kind of like the seed of an idea.

93
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Oh, right.

94
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,360
And its extent is how far that idea branches out.

95
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
I like that.

96
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
Yeah.

97
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
That's a good analogy.

98
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,000
And then they talk about this concept of crystallized content.

99
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Crystallized content.

100
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,240
Which gets into how information takes shape and interacts with the world.

101
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,240
Uh-huh.

102
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,040
So they further break that down into skeletal content and interactive content.

103
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,040
Okay.

104
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,200
You can think of skeletal content as like the framework or the blueprint of information.

105
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Gotcha.

106
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,640
And then interactive content is how that information engages with its surroundings.

107
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,400
So skeletal is like the bones.

108
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Yeah.

109
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Interactive is how it moves.

110
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Exactly.

111
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
You're getting it.

112
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Okay.

113
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,120
So we've got substance and essence and tend and extent crystallized content.

114
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,720
It seems like it info has a whole family of terms here.

115
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Yeah.

116
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
It does.

117
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
There's a lot of new words to learn.

118
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
There are and there's a few more.

119
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
Okay.

120
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,720
Hit me.

121
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,720
Like a fundamental building block.

122
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
Janium.

123
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
Okay.

124
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
We'll get into that one a little bit later.

125
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
Okay.

126
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,800
Then you have unithread, which is basically the thread that connects pieces of information

127
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
together.

128
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,000
So like if information is like beads, the unithread is the string that makes a necklace.

129
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Perfect analogy.

130
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

131
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,520
And then finally we have the uninet, pronounced uninet, which is the network formed by all

132
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,040
those interconnected unithreads.

133
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,720
So it's like a giant web where all these threads of information come together.

134
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Exactly.

135
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
They all kind of interact.

136
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,520
I think it's starting to see the web taking shape here.

137
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
Yeah.

138
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
We've got threads.

139
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,800
We've got the uninet, all these interconnected ideas.

140
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,600
But where do we fit into all this?

141
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,640
That's where the concept of the obop comes in.

142
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
Obop.

143
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
Pronounced obop.

144
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
Okay.

145
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,960
It's short for observer operator.

146
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,960
Okay.

147
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,280
You can kind of think of it as your point of view within the uninet.

148
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,680
So it's like the lens through which you perceive and interact with this information.

149
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,160
So are we the obop?

150
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
In a way, yes.

151
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,120
We each act as an obop with our own unique perspectives and ways of understanding the world.

152
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,520
So we're not just like passively observing this.

153
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,760
We're actively shaping how we see it.

154
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Exactly.

155
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,920
And each obop has what they call a view cone.

156
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
View cone.

157
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,080
Which represents the limits of their perception.

158
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
So it's kind of like tunnel vision in a way.

159
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
You could think of it that way.

160
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Okay.

161
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
It's like looking through a telescope.

162
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,640
You can only see a limited portion of the sky at any given time.

163
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640
Right.

164
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,040
A whole universe beyond your field of vision.

165
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Right.

166
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,240
So it's like that with the uninet too.

167
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,800
So we're like these little explorers going through this information jungle.

168
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Yeah.

169
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Each with our own limited view.

170
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Yeah.

171
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,320
But each view is also unique.

172
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,320
Right.

173
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,280
So you're seeing things that other people aren't.

174
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
Interesting.

175
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
Yeah.

176
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,320
And then Lininfo also introduces these two processes called CIE.

177
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
CIE pronounced A.

178
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Yeah.

179
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Yeah.

180
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
I'll try to remember that.

181
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
And then Cypher.

182
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Cypher.

183
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
Which is pronounced Cypher.

184
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Yeah.

185
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
What are those about?

186
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,080
So CIE is about how we interpret information.

187
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
Okay.

188
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,920
It's like how our brains make sense of the world through our senses.

189
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Right.

190
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Like we see light.

191
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,920
We hear sounds.

192
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
We smell aromas.

193
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
Yeah.

194
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,280
CIE is kind of involved in processing all that raw data into something meaningful.

195
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,720
So it's how we translate the language of the uninet into something we can understand.

196
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Precisely.

197
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,480
And Cypher, on the other hand, is more about the computational processing of information.

198
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,240
Okay.

199
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,700
And kind of like a set of algorithms that act on the information much like a computer

200
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,000
processes data.

201
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,960
So CIE is how we perceive it.

202
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,560
Cypher is how we analyze it.

203
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Exactly.

204
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
So our brains are like constantly running algorithms on the uninet.

205
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,000
In a way, yes.

206
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,320
And then there's this really intriguing concept called the law of the same content.

207
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,680
The law of the same content.

208
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Yeah.

209
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Okay.

210
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,680
That sounds important.

211
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
Yeah.

212
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
It's definitely a core principle in uninfo.

213
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
What does it say?

214
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,560
It's that the essential content of information remains constant even as it tucks on different

215
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
forms.

216
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,520
So like even if it's expressed differently, right?

217
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,120
Or if it's perceived from different perspective, it's kind of like water, you know, water

218
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,360
can be ice, it can be liquid, it can be vapor, but it's still H2O at its core.

219
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
Right.

220
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,520
So the law of the same content is saying there's a fundamental truth to information.

221
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,560
It doesn't change no matter how it's presented.

222
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,560
Exactly.

223
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
Okay.

224
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
That's pretty profound.

225
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,640
That leads us to some of the brainstorms that are included in these notes.

226
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
Oh, the braids, doggies.

227
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,800
Yeah, where they kind of explore the implications of all these concepts.

228
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,040
And yeah, I'm ready for some mind bending ideas.

229
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,400
Well, one of them grapples with the challenge of expressing subtle emotions.

230
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Oh, yeah.

231
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:35,120
So it suggests that certain types of information are really difficult to capture and convey

232
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
accurately.

233
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
Yeah.

234
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,800
Like some things are just beyond words.

235
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Exactly.

236
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,360
And it highlights how uninfo acknowledges those limitations.

237
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Okay.

238
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,520
Trying to capture every nuance of reality.

239
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,080
So some information might be harder to pin down than others.

240
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,680
That's a good way to put it in this unit.

241
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Yeah.

242
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,520
And it also makes you wonder what kind of information gets prioritized.

243
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
Right.

244
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,120
And how that affects our understanding of the world.

245
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,400
That is fascinating.

246
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Yeah.

247
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,640
And then there's this other interesting idea about karma and sescora, which are these

248
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,920
concepts from Buddhism, dealing with actions and their consequences.

249
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Okay.

250
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,920
So it shows that these can actually be seen as forms of information storage.

251
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,600
So you're saying our past actions are like data points in the unit.

252
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,680
It's a thought-provoking idea, isn't it?

253
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,600
Because it suggests that information isn't just static.

254
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Right.

255
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,480
It carries this weight of experience, action, consequence.

256
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,960
So the unit is like a living, breathing record of everything that's happened.

257
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,200
That's one way to think about it.

258
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Wow.

259
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Okay.

260
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
This is getting really deep.

261
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Yeah.

262
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
And then there's one more that I want to share with you.

263
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Okay.

264
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,000
So the images that they use is this idea of the self as a hurricane's eye.

265
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay.

266
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm intrigued.

267
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,200
So, you know, imagine the swirling chaos of a hurricane, all that energy and movement.

268
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Yeah.

269
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,280
But at the very center in the eye of the storm, there's stillness.

270
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,440
There's suggesting that our sense of self amidst all of this constant flow of information

271
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
and experiences.

272
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,080
It could be like that eye.

273
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Exactly.

274
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,600
A place of calm and clarity within the storm.

275
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,560
So even though we're surrounded by this whirlwind of information, there's a potential for

276
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
like inner peace.

277
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
Exactly.

278
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
And stability.

279
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
It's a beautiful and powerful metaphor.

280
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
It is.

281
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Yeah.

282
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:28,080
This deep dive into union foe is connecting with something much deeper than just information

283
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
science.

284
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
It is.

285
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,400
It's tapping into these questions like consciousness.

286
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Yeah.

287
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,360
And self awareness, even spirituality.

288
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
It definitely has a lot of philosophical depth.

289
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Yeah.

290
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,560
Before we get too carried away with the philosophy though, there are a few more key concepts from

291
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,600
this whole union foe family that we need to explore.

292
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Definitely.

293
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,040
I'm really interested in this idea of the observer operator.

294
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Yeah.

295
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,440
It seems really central to how we interact with the unit.

296
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
It is.

297
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,200
So let's unpack that a little bit more.

298
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Let's do it.

299
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,240
How does the abop perceive and shape the flow of these unit threads?

300
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
All right.

301
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Let's get into it.

302
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
Lead the way.

303
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
Yeah.

304
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,760
We love the unit like this big web of information made up of unit threads with us as these abops

305
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,160
kind of navigating it through our own few cones.

306
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,560
But how does it actually work in practice?

307
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
Yeah.

308
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,080
How do these threads actually get woven?

309
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
Right.

310
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,680
And like what role do CIE and cypher play in shaping the information landscape?

311
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
Yeah.

312
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,080
It's definitely a dynamic process.

313
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
Okay.

314
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,720
Remember how we talked about the unit being like this giant web?

315
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Mm-hmm.

316
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,560
Each unit thread like a spider silt kind of weaving its way through this network.

317
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Okay.

318
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
Right.

319
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,320
And as it travels it encounters different abops each with their unique view cone and their

320
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,040
own ways of processing information.

321
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
So each unit thread is kind of on a journey.

322
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
Yeah.

323
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,440
Encountering different perspectives and interpretations as it goes.

324
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
That's a great way to put it.

325
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Okay.

326
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,000
And with each encounter the unit thread is transformed.

327
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's enriched by that all-bops understanding and processing.

328
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,880
So CIE and cypher are involved in this transformation?

329
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
Oh, absolutely.

330
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
Okay.

331
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,120
CIE is like the initial filter.

332
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,200
You know, it shapes how the abot perceives the information.

333
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Oh, okay.

334
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,120
That's contained within that unit thread.

335
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,200
It's kind of like putting on a pair of glasses.

336
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Yeah.

337
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
With a specific tint.

338
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Okay.

339
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,600
It colors how you see things.

340
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Okay.

341
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,520
So then cypher kicks in to kind of analyze and process that information.

342
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Exactly.

343
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,640
Cypher is like the brain behind the operation.

344
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
Okay.

345
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,680
That information that's been filtered through CIE, running it through its algorithms,

346
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,520
interpretations, connections.

347
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,880
So the unit thread isn't just passively passing through?

348
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
No.

349
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,080
It's actively being shaped and reshaped by every abot bit encounters.

350
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Precisely.

351
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,280
It's like a river, you know, flowing through a diverse landscape.

352
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,680
As it travels, it picks up different sediments, nutrients.

353
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,760
It changes its core, sits composition based on the terrain it encounters.

354
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
I like that.

355
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,920
So similarly, the unit thread is constantly evolving.

356
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,160
As it interacts with the different abops and their unique ways of processing information.

357
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:10,240
But if each abop is kind of shaping the unit thread, according to their own perspective,

358
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,640
wouldn't that lead to like a chaotic and unreliable unit?

359
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
Right.

360
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,200
How can we be sure that the information is accurate and trustworthy?

361
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,360
That's where the law of the same content comes into play.

362
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,200
It's like the anchor that keeps the unit from drifting into complete subjectivity.

363
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Right.

364
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,400
Even as the unit thread is being filtered through different view cones processed by various

365
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:37,560
cycipher algorithms, the core, meaning the essential content remains constant.

366
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,360
So there's a fundamental truth embedded in each unit thread that can't be erased no matter

367
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
how many transformations it undergoes?

368
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,360
Precisely.

369
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,280
It's a fascinating paradox, isn't it?

370
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
It is.

371
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,920
The unit thread is constantly evolving.

372
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:57,080
But at its core, there's a persistent essence that transcends those individual interpretations.

373
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,640
This reminds me of that brainstorm we talked about about karma and Suskar being like these

374
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,440
forms of information storage.

375
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,620
It's almost as if each unit thread is carrying a history of its interactions, like a record

376
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,840
of all the perspectives it's encountered.

377
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,920
It's a very insightful connection in the unit.

378
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,640
It suggests that information in the unit info isn't just about cold hard data.

379
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
It's about experience.

380
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,120
It's about the accumulation of meaning and interpretation over time.

381
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,720
So each unit thread has like a story to tell.

382
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Yes.

383
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,400
It's constantly unfolding as it travels through the unit and encounters different obops.

384
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,240
And those stories, those interconnected unit threads, they create this written or tapestry

385
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,480
of knowledge and meaning that makes up the unit net.

386
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:49,320
It's a dynamic ever evolving system where the observer and the observed are constantly

387
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,480
shaping the information landscape.

388
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,960
This is really making me rethink how I view information.

389
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,040
It's not just these static data points.

390
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,200
It's a living breathing ecosystem where everything's connected and constantly influencing

391
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
each other.

392
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Exactly.

393
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,840
And the implications extend far beyond just how we understand data and facts.

394
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,840
An info touches on these fundamental questions about consciousness or perception, the nature

395
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,480
of reality itself.

396
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,360
Now you're making my head spin.

397
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:23,160
We've got these unit threads weaving through the unit net being shaped by obops, filtered

398
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:30,320
through CIE, processed by cipher, all while adhering to the law of the same content.

399
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,600
It is a lot to wrap your head around, but there's a beautiful elegance to it.

400
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
There is.

401
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,360
Think of it like this every piece of information, every concept, every idea, it has multiple

402
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
layers.

403
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Okay.

404
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
It has its substance.

405
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,360
It has its essence.

406
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
Right.

407
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,160
It has the relationship between those two.

408
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,080
You're talking about the trinion, right?

409
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,200
That fundamental building block of an info.

410
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Yeah.

411
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,320
I'm still a little fuzzy on how that fits into the whole picture.

412
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
It's crucial.

413
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,120
Remember those beads on a string we were talking about?

414
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Yeah.

415
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,240
Well, an ear and a foe, each bead, each piece of information along the unit thread is actually

416
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,560
a trinion.

417
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,920
So each point along the unit thread isn't just a single piece of data.

418
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,320
It's this multifaceted entity with substance essence and the relationship between the two.

419
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Exactly.

420
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,320
It's like the thread of interconnected triads.

421
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
Wow.

422
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,240
It creates this incredibly rich and nuanced flow of information.

423
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,760
So the complexity of the unit net is amplified by the fact that each unit thread is made up

424
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,280
of these multi-dimensional trinions.

425
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
So precisely.

426
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,560
And then that complexity is further enhanced by that continuous interaction with obops and

427
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,080
their individual CIE and cypher processes.

428
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,960
So the unit net is like a tapestry woven from these intricate trinions.

429
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
It is.

430
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,200
Constantly being shaped and reshaped by the perspectives and interpretation of talentless

431
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,800
obo of all these different obops.

432
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Yeah.

433
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,560
That's a beautiful way to picture it.

434
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,560
It is.

435
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,800
It's a constantly evolving masterpiece.

436
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,240
This dynamic interplay between the observer and the observed.

437
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,160
This is really blowing my mind.

438
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,000
It's like we're peering into the fabric of reality.

439
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,680
That's the beauty of info.

440
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,640
Seeing the interconnectedness of everything.

441
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,160
It offers you a new lens to view the world through.

442
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,840
One that reveals the interconnectedness and the complexity of information and our relationship

443
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,840
to it.

444
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,680
Well, I'm definitely starting to see the world in a whole new light.

445
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,880
We've covered a lot of ground here from the mind jungle to the unit net.

446
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Ah, from CIE and cypher to the law of the same content.

447
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
Yeah.

448
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,880
It's been a wild ride.

449
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
It has been a wild ride.

450
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,880
And we're not done yet.

451
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
OK.

452
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,720
There's still so much more to explore, especially with those thought-provoking brainstorms

453
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,960
and their implications for how we understand ourselves and the world around us.

454
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
OK.

455
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
Lead the way.

456
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm ready for the next layer of the deep dive.

457
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
All right.

458
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Let's do it.

459
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,840
So we've been talking about this idea of the unit net as this big web of interconnected

460
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
unit threads.

461
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Right.

462
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,680
And we talked about CIE and cypher.

463
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
Yeah.

464
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,560
Those processes that kind of filter and process information through our own unique lenses

465
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
as ABOPs.

466
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Exactly.

467
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,880
And the law of the same content.

468
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Right.

469
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Right.

470
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,720
Which says there's a core truth to information that doesn't change no matter what.

471
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,120
A fundamental truth.

472
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,720
But I'm still kind of stuck on the trinion.

473
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
Yeah.

474
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,360
You said each point on the unit thread is actually a trinion.

475
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,360
Right.

476
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Not just a simple data point.

477
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
It's not.

478
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
So can we dig into that a little more?

479
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,360
Sure.

480
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,680
I think that's key to understanding how a linear info views information.

481
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
It is.

482
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,040
The trinion is about how everything we encounter has these three fundamental aspects.

483
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
OK.

484
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,640
And the essence, the essence and the relationship between those two.

485
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,640
OK.

486
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Break that down for me.

487
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
OK.

488
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
Because it's still kind of abstract.

489
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
Sure.

490
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
So think about a book.

491
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,640
OK.

492
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
A book.

493
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
It's substance is its physical form, right?

494
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
Right.

495
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
The paper, the ink.

496
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
The pages, the binding, all of that.

497
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Yeah.

498
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
That's what you can touch and see.

499
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
OK.

500
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,880
But a book also has an essence.

501
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
Right.

502
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
The story.

503
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,880
The story, the ideas, the emotions it evokes.

504
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Right.

505
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
It makes you feel things.

506
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
Right.

507
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,200
And that essence is intangible, but it's just as important as the physical book itself.

508
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
OK.

509
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
I get the distinction.

510
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Yeah.

511
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Substance is the physical thing.

512
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,000
Essence is the meaning behind it.

513
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Exactly.

514
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,840
But what about the relationship between the two?

515
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
Right.

516
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
Why is that its own thing?

517
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,840
Well, the relationship is what highlights the interconnectedness.

518
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
OK.

519
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,560
The substance in the essence aren't separate entities.

520
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,880
They exist in this dynamic interplay.

521
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
OK.

522
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,680
So the physical book wouldn't be a book without the story inside it.

523
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
Right.

524
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,160
And the story wouldn't exist without that physical form to carry it.

525
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
Right.

526
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,520
So the relationship is saying they're two sides of the same coin.

527
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Exactly.

528
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,520
And this principle applies to everything, not just physical objects.

529
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,920
So ideas, emotions, concepts, all of it.

530
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,720
They all have substance and essence in that relationship.

531
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Yeah.

532
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
OK.

533
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,040
So that adds another layer to this whole uninet idea.

534
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
It does.

535
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
So each unit thread is like--

536
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Yeah.

537
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
--it's not just a bunch of data points.

538
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Right.

539
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
--it's a sequence of interconnected trillions.

540
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Yes.

541
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,880
--with their own substance essence and that relationship.

542
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
Precisely.

543
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,520
It's this multifaceted nature of information.

544
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Yeah.

545
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,000
--that makes the uninet so dynamic and intricate.

546
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,760
And then you add in CIE and Cypher, the way that each obop perceives and processes those trillions.

547
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760
Exactly.

548
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,760
--It just gets more and more complex.

549
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
Yeah.

550
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,760
It keeps adding layers.

551
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,960
Another layer of interpretation, another thread in the tapestry.

552
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,240
It's like those brainstorms we were looking at, karma and Sascara as information storage.

553
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
Yeah.

554
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
And then, the whole thing is like the whole thing that we're looking at.

00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,240

584
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,380
keep exploring this whole concept of uni info.

585
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,060
- But uni's just beginning.

586
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,280
- For our listeners who want to learn more,

587
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,160
we've got some links in the show notes.

588
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,420
- Definitely check those out.

589
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,080
- Where you can dive deeper into uni info.

590
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,920
- Yeah.

591
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,760
- See how it connects to web development philosophy,

592
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,020
cognitive science, and a whole bunch of other stuff.

593
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,360
- All sorts of things.

594
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,720
- So yeah, don't be afraid to get lost in the mind jungle.

595
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,640
- Exactly.

596
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,740
- You might be surprised, what you find.

597
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,940
- You never know.

598
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,800
- Until next time, keep exploring!

599
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,880
- Keep exploring!
