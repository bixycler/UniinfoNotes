- Techniques
	- [Zettelkästen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) (card file, slip box) from Germany, from 1980s: It use **paper slips** or cards, that may be linked to each other through [subject headings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_term "Index term") or other [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata "Metadata") such as numbers and [tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata) "Tag (metadata)"). It has often been used as a system of [note-taking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note-taking "Note-taking") and [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management "Personal knowledge management") for research, study, and writing.

- Software
	- [NoteCards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoteCards "NoteCards") from 1983 can be seen as the grand parent of the modern [[wiki]].
	- [Roam Reseach](https://roamresearch.com/) from 2019 (dev from 2017) with text block based handling ([[outliner|outlining]]), [[wikilink]], and [tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)) can be seen as the (re)start of the modern graph-based note taking movement.
	- [[Obsidian software|Obsidian]] from 2020 is similar to Roam but focus on clean & interoperable markdown documents, with better GUI, plenty of plugins, strong community. However, text block based handling is not as fluidly as in Roam.
	- [[Logseq]] (dev from 2021, still beta now) open-source, focus more on the text block based outlining (like Roam) with some drawbacks:
		- Every block is a bullet item, so no plain paragraph!
		- A database sits between GUI and markdown docs.
	- [Outline](https://www.getoutline.com/) with strong integrations, but no block link (only page link)
		- Integrations: multiplayer collaboration, Slack, Google (Workspace, Docs), GitHub, AI (non-free), etc.
		- Source code: They host [repos on GitHub](https://github.com/outline) in which [rich-markdown-editor](https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor) is open-source.
		- For Google account, only Workspace account is supported, personal account is not supported.

- Reviews
	- [Roam vs. Obsidian vs. Notion vs. Evernote: what's the best tool for a productivity-driven lifestyle?](https://www.deliberate-diligence.com/roam-vs-obsidian-vs-evernote-whats-best-for-a-productivity-driven-lifestyle/) A well-documented story of Martin Weitzel's personal progress 
		- from paper notes 
		- to [MS OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) with chronological order + [todoist](https://todoist.com/) (+ [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/)), 
		- to [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) with databases and dashboards,
		- to [Roam Reseach](https://roamresearch.com/) with text block based handling, [[wikilink]], and [tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)),
		- to [[Obsidian software|Obsidian]] with better GUI, plugins, community, but text block based handling is annoying.
			- However, Martin Weitzel had some mistake when thinking that ~~Obsidian is "open-source"~~, nope it's *proprietary* from the beginning.
