The icon of Unïnfo Theory is a split torus named “Unitorus” representing the Universe and the [[Trinion]] equation:

# 

◯ = ↑

#### 

“Circle equals Arrow”

Circle (◯) and Arrow (↑) are just two different manifestations of the Universe, shown up in different views of the same Unitorus, as shown in [[#canvasContainer|this animation]]. Especially, the following position of the Unitorus shows the [[Trinion|Trinion symbol ((\Trinion))]] where Circle (◯), Arrows (↑, ↓) and Equal (=) are shown together.

Mathematically, Unitorus is a solid torus split by a thick [Möbius strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip), resulting in a right-handed [trefoil knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil_knot). It's mathematically defined in the GeoGebra applet “[UniTorus](https://www.geogebra.org/m/kgqctbes)”.

The Unitorus shows many relativities via visual illusions in its [[#canvasContainer|animation]]:

1. The Unitorus is spinning like a wheel or turning inside out? ([Screw-in effect](https://www.geogebra.org/m/ww9kke87))
2. Does the Unitorus stop spinning while it's being rotated (the view angle is being rotated) around the vertical axis?
3. The see-through gaps of the split is covered by purple glass or grey glass? (Uncheck the “Glass cover” checkbox at the right side to see it clearer.)
4. With glass cover removed, the Unitorus is composed of 3 pieces or 2 inter-linked pieces or just 1 piece?

Other simpler relativities are:

- The Unitorus is spinning clockwise or counter-clockwise?
- The shapes on the Unitorus are flowing upward or downward or leftward or rightward? (As being indicated by the arrows.)

Moreover, at the front view, where the Unitorus stands upright and shows up as a round circle, can you see the rightward arrow together with the leftward arrow in the animation?
