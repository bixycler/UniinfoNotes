“CIE” is pronouced /saɪ/ or /si/ whichever rhymes with the Greek letter “Ψ”.

While the three components of [[Trinion|the Trinion]] (○, ↑, =) show the objective and qualitative structure of the Universe, the Trinion itself observes the Universe via the _subjective and quantitative_ observer-operator(obop) of [[FoC|the FoC]]. The _**obop being (◉)**_ works with the following three components:

- **Content (_c_):** This is the object to be observed and measured, the measuree, the domain of operation, the unknown amount of material.
- **Intent (_i_):** This is the subject that measures the object, the measurer, the unit of measurement, the modulus of division, the operator, the known amount of material which act as the container of content. In perception, it's the “eye's self”, the projector that projects the material object onto the mental world. The operation of measuring or projecting the unknown (_c_) against the known (_i_) is illustrated by the division _c/i_.
- **Extent (_e_):** This is the number resulting from the measurement, the rage of the operation, the image of projection. This number is non-material and purely a mental construction by the intent.

There, “CIE” stands for “_content/intent = extent_” or “_content = intent × extent_”, where “extent” is the image of the object's “content”, and “intent” gives meaning to that image.

In dualistic view, these three components are 2-1 divided rotationally in three partitions:

- **Sustent (_c_, _i_) - Extent (_e_):** In the mapping _i: c → e_, the source _c_ and the mapper _i_ are the ones that determine and maintain the image _e_ which, in its turn, extends the intent _i_ into the _extension i⋅e_. Thus, the construct used to extend the intent is called “extent” (_e_). The extent is the extended part of the content, denoting the size, magnitude, amount of content. And the substances used to sustain the extension are called “sustents” (_c_, _i_). Sustent is the invisible _underlying substance_ of all things that are expressed in the mind of the subject as visible extents which are just mental images. In this way, the partition “sustent - extent” is also called the “**Physical (_c_, _i_) - Informational (_e_)**” or “material - mental” partition. While the extent cannot exist without the sustent, the sustent is self-sustained because it's a closed circle comprising two complements of form (intent _i_ and extension _i⋅e_) and content (_c_).
- **Form (_i_, _e_) - Content (_c_):** In the projection _c →i e_, the _internal form_ _i_ of the obop's **eye** defines the _format_ for the content _c_, so that _c_ appears to the obop as the _external form e_. While in philosophy and science, “form” usually refers to internal forms like format, formular, structure, in natural language, “form” usually refers to external forms like shape, appearance. Here, the two forms are united to contrast with the content. While the external form _e_ is “abstract”, i.e. empty of content, the internal form _i_ is “concrete” with _crystalized content_ from its sustents. Another concrete form is the “concrete extension” _i⋅e_ denoting concrete objects in the material world of the obop. In contrast, the extent _e_ is an “abstract extension” denoting abstract objects in the mental world of the obop. Most of the maths, logic, and information technology work with abstract extensions only, which manifests as numbers, symbols, signs, sets, etc. Because the internal form of the eye is especially important to the subject (obop) and the pronunciation of letter “i” is the same as the word “eye”, “i” is usually used to denote the _eye of projection_, where it can also means “I, the subject of projection”. Because the internal form _i_ represents the [self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self) of the subject, and the external form represents the image projected in the mind of the subject, this partition is also called the “**M(_i_, _e_) - W(_c_)**” (“Mine vs Wild”, or “Me vs World”) partition, or the “_Mirror partition_”. Here, the form (concrete extension _i⋅e_) reflects the content: _c = i⋅e_.
- **Extensive (_e_, _c_) - Intensive (_i_):** In the observation function _e = obi(c) = c/i_ and the operation function _c = opi(e) = i⋅e_, the _variables_ _e_ & _c_ are extensive properties, while the _parameter_ _i_ is an intensive property, as in the categorization of [physical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties). That means, in the subjective view of the obop, its intent _i_ is kept invariant, while the extent _e_ varies directly with the conent _c_. Otherwise, in the objective view, the total content of the Universe ([domain of discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse)) is considered fixed _c_ = 1, hence the inverse variation of the two forms, intension _i_ and abstract extension _e_: _1/i = e_. Here, the intent _i_ gives intension, meaning, to the extent _e_, “_e_ means _e times i_”, so that the abstract extension _e_ can be used in place of the concrete extension _i⋅e_. As the obop _i_ ranges over the content _c_ to yield corresponding number _e_, _i_ is known as the _index_, the _indicator_ of the “current position” (the “here”), also the _interator_ of the “current time” (the “now”).

Actually, the name of the three components “content - intent - extent” are taken from the fewer side of each partition. Othwerwise, the triple (_c_, _i_, _e_) can be called “content - context - form”.

### Relativity & Pseudo-absoluteness

- **Intrinsic relativity, apparent form & measured content**: All forms and contents are only visible, measurable via their extent against some eye _i_, and that extent shows the _external form apparent to that eye_, which is called “**apparent form**”. That means all forms and contents are intrinsically relative to each other, and their relation _c_/_i_, denoted by _e_, is _all the information they can **see and agree together**_. In other words, the “content” _c_ is just the form that is subjected to measurement by the “intent” _i_, hence “content” = “object form” and “intent” = “subject form”. The extent _e_ seen by _i_ agrees with _c_ in the sense that, as a subject form, _c_ sees that _i_ has extent 1/_e_. Considering intents as units, we have the measured content of _c_ is _i⋅e_ and the measured content of _i_ is _c_⋅1/_e_. Note that the measured content _i⋅e_ is just an aspect of the underlying content _c_ which cannot be measured completely, i.e. _the content itself is **immeasurable** even though measurable_ .
- **Pseudo-absoluteness, crystal form & crystalized content**: When there's a **common intent _i0_** which is so fine that can measure all forms in a world, that world has a sense of absoluteness where all forms have “pseudo-absolute extent _e0_” defined by _i0_. As long as _i0_ is stable, the “pseudo-absolute extent _e0_” is stable and can be used to express the “crystalized content” of all forms in this world, where the common unit _i0_ is ignored. The finer _i0_ is, the more stable the “crystalized content” is, as well as the “crystal forms” made up from this “crystalized content”. Note that while the notion of an “infinitely fine common intent” can define an “absolute world” with all forms absolutely defined exactly by an “absolute extent”, in reality, no matter how fine the common intent is, all extents are relative to that common intent. Hence, that absoluteness is just a pseudo-absoluteness. However, that pseudo-absolute extent is enough to show various hidden structures underlying the relative world, e.g. the triangle inequality.
- **Triangle inequality**:

    The the amount of crystalized content of a form must be greater, and usually much greater, than any measured content of that form, i.e. _c_ > _i⋅e_ and _i_ > _c_⋅1/_e_. That crystalized content is called the “capacity” of the corresponding crystal form.

#### B. Vietnamese terms

- Extent - intent: số lượng - tính chất (lượng - chất), (ngoại) hình - (nội) thức
- Số lượng (extent) = quantity = số (number, phase) + lượng (amount): Here "number" means "whole number" and "amount" means abitrary number.
- Sustent = content + intent: Tính = cảm tính (qualia) + lý tính (quanta)
- Sustent - extent: Tính - lượng
- Tính chất (intent) = quality = tính (nature, property = thuộc tính = attribute) + chất (substance, phase): Nature is the link between subject's property and object's attribute. A substance is a wholesome collection of complementary properties.

- Function = hàm: The old meaning of “_function as a container of variables and parameters_” ([Bernoulli 1718, Euler 1748](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_function_concept)), as captured by the Sino-Vietnamese term “hàm” [函], is retrieved here in the partition “extensive - intensive”. The modern meaning of “function as a mapping” was introduced by Dirichlet in 1837.
