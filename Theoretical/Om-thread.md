![](pub%2010.png)

In Unithread, [[Trinion|the Trinion]] is manifested as a “thread”, called “Ω-thread” [Ω] (Ōṁ-thread [Ω,ॐ], One-thread [Ω,𝟙], Omni-thread or Overall thread, Ouroboros thread), which is a closed directed dynamic metrizable refinable [topos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointless_topology). Its dynamic content and direction embody the Arrow (↑), its closeness embodies the Circle (◯), its metrizability and fefinability embody the Equal (=).

From the outside, the Ω-thread is seen as just a 0 point without any information. Different eyes in the Ω-thread see different views of the Ω-thread with different structures and information.

Abstract content -> + CIE (1 ◯) = concrete content -> + FoC (2 ◯) = time & demi-space -> + double FoC (3 ◯) = space & time

“current” = coarse-grained thread, “thread” = fine-grained current, compared to the resolution of the eye.
