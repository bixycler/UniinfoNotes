The self thread just flow steadily at constant speed c, the distortion produces all dynamics. Mass = condensed thread, P, F, E all result from distortion of thread. Gravity = stretched around the condensed.

## Elastic Dynamics

Spring, returning force

## Newtonian Dynamics

Exponential config, flow
