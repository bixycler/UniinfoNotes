  [[Trinion|The Trinion]] (\(\Trinion\)) is not an inanimate-insensate thing, but an _**alive being** with its static (○), dynamic (↑) and balance (=)_. However, _as the Universe **looking back at itself**_, the Trinion cannot see all of its components at once, but only some [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction) of itself.

- ### Analysis of the Trinion
  
  The Trinion uses the Equal (=) as an eye to look, so it can see anything except its own eye. Thus, the Equal (=) is first abstracted and the Trinion sees its body as an animate object but insensate due to the lack of the sensor (the eye). When the Trinion takes snapshot of its _**form** as a static Circle (○)_, the dynamic (↑) is abstracted, too. Thus, the form is just an abstract concept of an inanimate-insensate thing, captured by the symbol Circle (○). After many snapshots, the Trinion connects them into a sequence, then abstracts the form out to infer its _**content** as a static Arrow (↑)_. Thus, the animate content of the Trinion is captured by an inanimate symbol Arrow (↑). Finally, the Trinion reasons about the relation between what it has seen to draw the conclusion ⟪○ = ↑⟫, then abstracts the two known symbols Circle (○) and Arrow (↑) out to infer that its _**observer** is the Equal (=)_. Thus, the sensate[[[#SensateSentientConscious|1]]] observer of the Trinion is captured by an insensate symbol Equal (=), which represents the sensor (the eye). With the observed knowledge, the Trinion _operates_ its body according to the dynamic equation ⟪↑ ⇌ ○⟫, where the Equal (⇌) tells the body how to take _action (↑)_ to _transform (⇌○)_ itself. Thus, the Equal is also called the “_**operator**_” of the Trinion and denoted by the _composition symbol (☉)_[[[#SymbolsForOperators|2]]], where ⟪↑ ☉ ○⟫ is the operation of taking action (↑) on the form (○) to transform it. To unify both roles of the Equal, we call it the “_**obop**_” (observer-operator) of the Trinion. That's how the Trinion considers Circle (○), Arrow (↑) and Equal (=) to be _abstract form_, _abstract content_ and _abstract obop_, respectively. And in theory, we usually deal with those abstract things only, especially the variety of forms.

- ### Integration and working of the components
  
  Using the observer (☉), the Trinion can only directly see its insensate body, so it refers to _anything **without obop (☉)** as an **object**_, in contrast to _**subject** as anything **including all the three**, form (○), content (↑) and obop (☉)_. However, due to [[Trinion#Intrinsics|the intrinsics of Unïnfo]], all concrete things (beings) are subjects because they always have all the three components even if some compopents are hidden. That means in the wholistic view, _**concrete form**, **concrete content** and **concrete obop** are all subjects in their own right_. Here, the term “**being**” is reserved for subjects, so the concrete thing of an abstract “X” will be called “X being”, like _“form being” (●), “content being” (↣), “obop being” (◉)_. Especially, the **obop being (◉)**, as the mind of its subject, can be considered a “subject within subject” when the outer subject looks inside via self-reflection. As an observer, the operator being has its own form (the “eyeball”), with its own content (observing action), to reflect the external “real objects” (in the Trinion's body) into its “virtual objects” (in the eyeball) [perception], which interact with each other to generate new “virtual objects” [thinking] and to crystalize into new forms (the “knowledge”) of the being [conception]. After that observation phase, comes the operation phase where the operator being uses its own forms (the “eyeball” and the observed “knowledge”) to actualize the new “virtual objects” into new “real objects” to transform the external body of the Trinion. Hence, the term “operator” is used in subsumption of “observer”, where “observer” is an “inward operator” with observing action on the eyeball, and the normal “operator” is an “outward operator” acting on the external body of the Trinion.

  Moreover, the “virtual objects” are called “extensional objects”, or simply “**extensions**”, because they extend the “real objects” from one to many, and the collection of all extensional objects together with their relations make up the internal world called “**extension world**”. The part of the extension world containing only objects reflecting the “real objects” outside is projected outward to be called the “**actual world**”. Via transformation, the actual world can reach other parts of the extension world which are called “**possible worlds**”, where _the “actual world” is the “current possible world”_. The remaining part of the extension world comprises “impossible worlds” (purely imaginary worlds) and purely virtual objects called “concepts”. The forms of the obop being (“eyeball” and “knowledge”) together with the contents of the Trinion (“real objects”) make up the **intension** of the obop, whose extension is the extension world.
- ### Onion structure of the Trinion
  
  ![](Trinion-onion.png)
  
  There are many _layers of form_, one after another, containing their contents inside. For each layer of form, there are two kinds of contents, the **self content** which has crystalized into the form itself, and the **carried contents** which are inner layers enclosed by this layer. The self content of adjacent layers are _separated by the extremes (±∞)_, thus _independent_ from each other. Just like a bottle of water, both water (its carried contents, ⥁) and melted glass (its self content, ⇌) are dynamic relative to the static glass bottle (its form, ○). Back to the onion 🧅, at its base, there is a bud generating all those layers above, which has the potential to generate new layers in the future, that's the obop being of the Trinion, just like the seed of plants and the brain of animals.

- ### Apendix
- #### A. Terminology
- **Sensate**: Here we describe the ability of a subject to sense objects with the adjective _“sensate” and the noun “sensation” as the most basic sensing capability_. When subjects become more complicated, their more sophisticated capacity of sensing can be described with “sentient” and “conscious”. The concrete subjects (◉) that sense are called “observers/operators (being)” and the abstract objects that sense (☉), i.e. the Equal (=), are called “eyes/sensors”.
- **Symbols of the obop**: There are many symbols representing many roles of the obop. In Trinion, the Equal sign (=) is used to emphasize the balance and unification roles of the obop. In FoC, the composition symbol (☉) is used to show the dualities of the obop as both observer (○) and operator (·), composed of both form (○) and content (·), including both intent (·) and extent (○). The intent in the abstract obop (☉) is abstracted as a dimensionless point representing the “point of contact, incidence, intersection” between the subject and the object. The intent in the concrete obop (◉) is a concrete being with all of its internal content represented by the filled circle (●). In maths, the dot operator (⋅) and the circled dot operator (⊙) are used to denote the operation role of the obop. In theory of functions and in linguistics, the composition operator (∘), the interpunct (·) and the hypenation point (‧) are used to denote the dual role of connection-separation of the obop. In astrology, the symbol of Sun (☉) shows the role of the obop as a source of light. In computing, the fisheye symbol (◉) shows the role of the obop as an eye, a focal point, a selected choice, the current one.
