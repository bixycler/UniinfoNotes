Like [linear operators in Quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(physics)), operations on threads are transformations of the operands that keep the information conserved, i.e. "[unitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarity_(physics))" in Quantum mechanics. Note that most of [mathematical operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_(mathematics)) do not keep information conserved.
