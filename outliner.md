	- [em](https://github.com/cybersemics/em/wiki/Docs) is a process-oriented note-taking app with tree view & graph links, sophisticated with navigation operations.
	- [Legend](https://legendapp.com/) is smooth with web app, including desktop & mobile apps
		- Metadata (tag, properties) can be stored in "notes"
		- "Import from backup" always create [new doc with new ids](https://forum.legendapp.com/d/1747-import-from-backup-always-create-new-doc-with-new-ids-broken-links), hence all wikilinks are broken.
		- Moving item to an article (H1), using Alt-M or menu, doesn't work due to the [fake hierarchy of heading](https://forum.legendapp.com/d/519-inferred-hierarchy-from-heading-size/9).
	- [Checkvist](https://checkvist.com/) ...
		- Block ids are created only when wikilink inbound is created, then cached, hence not reflecting the real doc.
