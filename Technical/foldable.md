- Other names: collapsible, abstractable
- Description: A foldable object, usually a block of text, is an object that can be folded (or collapsed, abstracted) into a brief like header, title, name, summary, and that brief can be unfolded (or expanded, extended) back to the full object. This is a technical implementation of the general [[abstraction]].
- Examples:
	- Foldable [code block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(programming))s in [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) or blocks of text in [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor)s
	- The [[HTML]] [`<summary>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary) within the `<details>` tag
	- [Directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)) in collapsible tree view
	- [File folder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_folder) that holds [papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper "Paper") together
	- The [tab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_(interface)) in [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)
