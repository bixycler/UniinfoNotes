Just test some features of GitJournal!
Why the title cannot be set?!ðŸ¤”
- with list: 
- ..- 4 spaces indent each level!
    - 2nd level
    - 2.2
        - 3rd level
        - 3.2
            - 4th level
            - 4.2
        - The items look good!
    - No excessive indent!
- I chose Simplenote just because of this listing thing! :D

How about non-list indent? 

    Like this
    As a code block
    But lack auto indent continuation ðŸ˜•
Tab with long pressing the `>`, `<` buttons ðŸ˜œ
- nope ðŸ‘Ž 
- of

How about indent in/out?

- like this
                - Oh it's allowed!
        - arbitrary!
- how to indent in/out on mobile? ðŸ¤”
  - wow, it's [suggested](https://forums.simplenote.com/forums/topic/no-way-to-indent-tab-in-ios-app/) to use 3rd party keyboard for Tab key ðŸ˜•
     - but i just edit the indent manually with spaces before the item
- let's try different spaces of indent 
  ....
  - 2 spaces indent Ok for 2nd level
    ....
     - 3rd level requires 3 spaces
       ....
         - 4th level requires 4 spaces
           ....
             - 5th level requires 4 spaces
             - so 4 spaces indent is safest 
               ...
               But the next line
               will not be kept indented! That sucks ðŸ˜” And the wrapped lines are not indented neither! 

# Wikilink to [[README]] & [[TasksList]] ðŸ˜‰

Is there any way to insert Tab in the Android keyboard?!
