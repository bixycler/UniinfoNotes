- TODO 2025-06-04
  - 06:00 am: Last night i couldn't sleep due to the illness of both body and mind: the nose was stuffy and mildly sore, the mind ran endless stream of thoughts about ongoing personal works. 
    - Lying for more than an hour unable to sleep, i sat up to meditate and calm these thoughts down. 
    - Facing these perfectionist thoughts and urges to do, i saw they are really strong.
    - The body's illness was not strong enough to pull my mind out of these streams of thoughts.
    - The deadline of company work today has both roles: It reminds me to release these urges to complete personal works, while it also makes me stressed, keeping me from relaxing.
  - 06:30 am: Now, before going to company, i must prime my mind to do the company work first, let the task of syncing Git after the working hours: sync authenticators of mobile & desktop, sync GitJournal with Logseq.
  - 18:30 pm: After lots of hard works on company, now i return to the sync task: 
    - authenticators synced
    - Considering of merging GitJournal & Logseq to the same repo UniinfoNotes.
    - There's an issue with file handling in GitJournal: somehow the deleted/renamed ones die hard!?
    - The "external repo" setting doesn't work: fetch fails!
