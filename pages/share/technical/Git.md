		  is the warning of `diff` because `diff` is a **line-based** text processor.
			- Without the last newline, whenever the next line is appended to this file, the last line must be edited by adding newline to it, which is an unintended edit. This **unintended change** of the last line leads to various problem.
			- 1st, `diff` works with the whole line, hence, the last line will be marked as modified by the next commit.
				- E.g. wrong lines in diffs between commits without the last newline:
				  collapsed:: true
					- Final file
					  ```
					  Test EOL@EOF⏎
					  this line is in commit #1.⏎
					  this line is in commit #2.⏎
					  this line is in commit #3.
					  ```
					- commit #1
					  ```diff
					  +Test EOL@EOF⏎
					  +this line is in commit #1.
					  \ No newline at end of file
					  ```
					- commit #2
					  ```diff
					  Test EOL@EOF⏎
					  -this line is in commit #1.
					  \ No newline at end of file
					  +this line is in commit #1.⏎
					  +this line is in commit #2
					  \ No newline at end of file
					  ```
					- commit #3
					  ```diff
					  this line is in commit #1.⏎
					  -this line is in commit #2.
					  \ No newline at end of file
					  +this line is in commit #2.⏎
					  +this line is in commit #3
					  \ No newline at end of file

			  id:: ed8333ef-b3b6-4d1b-a5e7-3a2fb4e1b286
				- The conflict will be shown (for resolution) in a very obscure way, due to the difficulty of showing the newline itself.
				  ```git-merge-conflict
				  6: Last line without newline
				  <<<<<<< HEAD
				  7: Appended line by feature-testEOL-1
				  =======
				  >>>>>>> feature-testEOL-2
				  
				  ```
				- There are two options to fix this issue:
					- [Force all IDEs](((67aabd6b-a257-4eb7-8363-3d29035a30f4))) to automatically add the last newline.
					- [Stop Linux editors](((67aacefc-f707-49f4-b33d-ed73f63e3a64))), like `vim`, `nano`, from fixing files missing newline at the end of file.
					  id:: 67aacbe5-f534-4eac-abe8-15f2f8990691

		- submodule
		  id:: 67151eb0-94a3-47bb-a7f9-25561690e75d
			- Official docs: [7.11 Git Tools - Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
			- The file `$subrepo` is the link between the two commits of the inner & outer repos.
				- It contains a specific commit hash which has been added to the outer repo.
				- This inner repo commit should be chosen to match the current state of the outer repo.
			- The outer repo's `.gitmodules` tracks metadata (path & URL) of the `$subrepo`.
			- Note: A submodule usually use ((67152b95-02b4-473b-a88b-6cbab4b46749)) instead of the normal `.git/` folder, so that the outer repo can `git checkout` a branch that does not have this submodule. That's because the `checkout` has to remove the entire submodule's working tree, without losing the submodule's repo info.
		- nested repo as a normal folder
			- We can workaround by cheating Git.
				- 1st way: Move the `.git` in `$subrepo` away so that Git see `$subrepo` as a normal folder, add this folder, then move its `.git` back.
				  ```sh
				  mv $subrepo/.git $tmp/$subrepo.git
				  git add $subrepo
				  mv $tmp/$subrepo.git $subrepo/.git
				  ```
				- 2nd way: Use the low-level plumbing command
				  ```sh
				  git update-index --add $subrepo
				  ```
			- If `$subrepo` has been accidentally added as a nested repo, it must be removed first
			  ```sh
			  git rm [--cached] $subrepo
			  ```
			- Optionally, `$subrepo/.git` can also be `.gitignore`d by the outer repo. But this is unnecessary: By default, Git ignores all `.git` files/folders, because that's the default name for ((67152861-f595-4ad1-88a9-9363082d03eb)).

			- `--stat` -> `[trimmed-]file-path | change-num ++---` with file path trimmed off left side to fit the screen width, and with visually friendly syntax for file rename `{old-dir => new-dir}/{old-filename => new-filename}`.
			- `--word-diff` → `[-removed-]{+added+}` output word-by-word where "word" is defined as `\S+`, i.e. non-space string, which is coarser than the normal word.
			- `--color-words='(\w+|\W+)'` = `--word-diff=color --word-diff-regex='(\w+|\W+)'` to highlight changed words using only colors, without markups like `[-...-]{+...+}`.

				- Range with `-L $start`, `-L ,$end`, `-L $start,$end`
					- Both `$start` and `$end` can be a line number or a `/regex/`
					- `$end` can be `+offset` or `-offset`
				- Revision `$rev` can be given to blame edits from that `$rev` up, instead of from now (working directory).
					- Usually we use `$rev^` to find edits *before* `$rev` to trace back the history.
				- Many options for output format: `-s -b -w --date=human -M --color-lines --color-by-age`
		- Push another branch, not the current:

		- Force pull
			- To **overwrite** this branch with its upstream,

			  ```
				- Or the “standard combo” 
				  ```shell
				  git fetch --all
				  git reset --hard @{u} # shorthand: @{u} = @{upstream}
				  ```
				- Warning: `git reset --hard` is so strong that it can overwrite this branch with another *completely separate branch*, i.e. it's a “**hard set**”, not just a “hard ~~re~~set”!
			- To _**overwrite** another branch_ with its upstream, it's shorter with a single command:
			  collapsed:: true
			  ```sh
			  git fetch --force ${remote} ${branch}:${branch}
			  ```
				- What a pity that this command cannot be applied to the current branch!
				  ```sh
				  fatal: Refusing to fetch into current branch refs/heads/test_branch of non-bare repository
				  ```
				- Note the target local branch can be a completely different branch, even a new branch, e.g.
				  ```sh
				  git fetch --force ${remote} ${branch}:${other_branch}
				  ```
				- When the remote tracking branch `${remote}/${branch}` is different from the actual `${branch}` on `${remote}` repo, which is the case of remotely `push --force`, there will be 2 updates, e.g.:
				  ```sh
				  git fetch --force origin test_branch:other_branch
				  From github.com:bixycler/GitWorkflows
				   + 2174bba...189e558 test_branch -> other_branch  (forced update)
				     233e5d4..189e558  test_branch -> origin/test_branch
				  ```
					- 1st,`test_branch` on `origin` remote → remote tracking `origin/test_branch`, like the normal `git fetch`
					  ```sh
					     233e5d4..189e558  test_branch -> origin/test_branch
					  ```
					- 2nd, remote tracking `origin/test_branch` → local `heads/other_branch`, like `git reset --hard`
					  ```sh
					   + 2174bba...189e558 test_branch -> other_branch  (forced update)
					  ```
			- To **merge** with upstream even if the remote tracking branch `@{u}` is diverged from the branch on remote repo,
			  ```sh
			  git pull --force ${remote} ${branch}:${branch}
			  warning: fetch updated the current branch head.
			  fast-forwarding your working tree from
			  commit 2174bba0072daa0dc907f9049b9ecf597d812fb1.
			  fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.
			  ```
				- which is equivalent to (depending on `git config pull`)
				  ```shell
				  git fetch --force ${remote} ${branch}:${branch} # (pseudo-command!) warning: fetch updated the current branch head.
				  #git merge @{u} # when git config pull.rebase false (default)

			- ![Workflow: Project-Feature-Work-Store](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQhv6u8obu7p4GhPcOhxCZuZ5irV8DROkcdDrUU3Dgwe7jeU5r53nItkhfyYcIcBJMtP0cK1ozPDSgH/pub?w=430)
			- Branches
				- `work` branch
				  is the working branch keeping the full-detail history of all works.
					- Its working commits are kept as small as possible so that we can have fine-grained control of our works.
					- For a clear history, it's kept linear with `merge --squash` and `cherry-pick` instead of `merge`.
					- Use `merge --squash` to get codes from `project`
						- ```sh
						  work> git merge --squash project
						  ```
				- `feature` branch
				  is the middleman to bridge between the linear `work` branch and the octopus `project` branch.
					- For new `feature` branch, `checkout -b` from `project` branch.
						- ```sh
						  project> git checkout -b feature 
						  ```
					- `cherry-pick` feature commits from `work` for merge-request to `project`
					  id:: 66868431-a1d0-4df9-a250-0f8bb7bc1a56
						- ```sh
						  #work> git log # store commits to be cherry-picked, from old to new: ${base_exclusive}..${head_inclusive} ${ref1} ${ref2}
						  work> git checkout feature 
						  feature> git cherry-pick ${base_exclusive}..${head_inclusive} ${ref1} ${ref2}
						  ```
					- `rebase project` (and optionally squash feature commits them down with option `-i`) before creating merge request to `project` branch
					  id:: 669f79cc-08d5-4507-bd72-f8e1af4892d8
						- ```sh
						  feature> git rebase -i project
						  ```
						- Note: on the Merge request page, there's an option "Squash commits", but it's better to squash before hand with `rebase -i`.
				- `store` branch
				  is an optional branch to store coarse-grained commits of `work` branch corresponding to merge requests to `project`.
					- Whenever a [merge request](((669f79cc-08d5-4507-bd72-f8e1af4892d8))) is created, the corresponding chunk of `work` commits should be stored to `store` branch via a `merge --no-ff --log`.
						- ```sh
						  store> git merge --no-ff --log work
						  ```
						- This command can be stored as alias in `~/.gitconfig`.
							- ```ini
							  [alias]
							      mergel = merge --no-ff --log
							  ```
		- Revise commits from downstream (local, personal) to upstream (remote, redmine, project)
		  collapsed:: true
			- In case of only 1 commit to upstream: (for redmine)
				- ```shell
				  downstream> git checkout upstream
				  upstream> git pull # make sure it's updated
				  upstream> git merge --squash --strategy-option=theirs downstream
				  #... remove all except changes for the commit to upstream (git restore, git checkout HEAD, git rm, git clean)
				  upstream> git commit -sm "commit from downstream"
				  upstream> git push
				  ```
			- In case of many commits to upstream: (for project)
				- id:: 66b1cfa5-1ec8-4313-b635-2b22d705d19f
				  ```shell
				  downstream> git checkout upstream
				  upstream> git pull # make sure it's updated
				  upstream> git merge --squash --strategy-option=theirs downstream
				  upstream> git stash push -u # save downstream's changes 
				  upstream> git checkout stash -- .
				  #... remove all except changes for the 1st commit (git restore, git checkout HEAD, git rm, git clean)
				  upstream> git commit -sm "1st commit"
				  upstream> git checkout stash -- .
				  #... remove all except changes for the 2nd commit (git restore, git checkout HEAD, git rm, git clean)
				  upstream> git commit -sm "2nd commit"
				  #...
				  ```
			- Notes: Use `git checkout stash -- .` instead of `git stash apply` to overwrite current workdir
