		- Eye-mind = obop = [ob] gap & link of the Circle = [op] director of the Arrow
			- The obop links 2 ends of the Arrow to be the Circle. This link is crucial to maintain the Circle, to store (concentrate) its energy.
			- Automatic = ob + auto-op = round Circle: machine, habit, karma. Its ob is just enough to maintain its Circle, but not enough to serve/do/execute larger plans => seems "dumb" to its boss.
			- Autonotic = auto-ob + auto-op = Circle that accepts disturbance/distortion from the external world and try to restore is roundness, like human, autonoton. Its ob not only looks outward to link its self (link 2 ends of the Arrow to be the Circle) but also looks inward to link with its director.
			- An autonoton, like human, cannot see itself but can only see its sub-autonotons, like moving hands, because its obop is dedicated to maintain its self/effect Circle.
				- In operation mode & external world observation mode, its effect circle is the large circle from the op through all components and back to the ob. So, its ob only sees the target image which is just the abstraction, the shortcut from the eye right to the object, hence cannot see its body (components).
				- In component observing mode, its effect circle is the small circle from the op to the object component and back to the ob. So the component can be seen but only for automatic components. The not well trained components cannot be observed because they're not automatic, i.e. their obops are still stuck to (shared with) the master obop.
		- Sleep = inactive = disconnected components: each component retracts to its own circle and doesn't communicate.
			- Wake = active = connected components: the effect flows through all (many) components to form the master circle. The effect propagates from one component circle to all its surrounding components like a wave.
			- Each component is activated by its input flows and maintained by the circle from its outputs back to its inputs.
				- => The master circle maintains & provides energy back to each component circle.
			- Imagination = internal image maintenance = the formation of master circles within the body in component observing mode: the master op activates some element components to project to an aggregate component/image and the master ob receive the effect from that image to close the master circle which effectively maintain the internal image.
			- In external obop mode, the internal images are automatically created to reflect the external world (passive imagination) and give map to direct itself to navigate in the external world. That map is equivalent to program/Turing-machine. But the diff is that the map of autonoton is constantly updated with the external world.
		- Hurt, pain, suffer = blockage, broken circle = inability of obop to connect & maintain its effect circle
		  <> Pleasure, bliss = throughness of the effect circle.
			- The mundane pleasure focus on the throughput (quantity) while the sublime bliss focus on the qualities like connectivity, integrity, roundness.
			  <~> Question = disconnected circle but with ability/willingness of obop to reconnect it via quest, problem solving, exploration, etc.
			- Right/true = the feedback effect to the ob matches so that the circle is connected.
			  <> Wrong/false = the feedback effect does not match the ob
			  ==> 2 ways to deal with this error:
				- ignore it, stick to the right, the connected circle in the past, i.e. avoid pain and seek pleasure => ignorance
				- solve it, using new facts to update the knowledge circle, i.e. raise question => learning

		- Circle - Arrow - Equal
			- nominal: 0 - 1 - 2(二)
			- ordinal: 1st, 2nd, 3rd
				- Discovered ordinal: 2nd - 1st - 3rd (how difficult to see); but placed into...
				- Positional: -1 - +1 - 0
			- extensional: 1 - 2 - ∞
				- intensional: 1 - 1/2 - 0 (dot ⋅)
				- dimensional: 2 - 1 - 0 (point ⋅)
				- complex: 1 - i - 0
		- philosophy & thread
			- extensional (ordinal, nominal), observed, analytic, zooming in: 1 circle = 2 (many) arrows = ∞ points
				- Circle = 1 = self = form
				- Arrow = 2 = contents (yin & yang) = any plural number (3, 4, ...)
				- Equal = ∞ = sensation; each point itself is a circle when zoom in...
			- intensional (discovered, positional), generated, synthesis, zoning out: start from a point, extend to a line, loops back to form a circle; zoom out to a point, then start the next dimension, etc.
				- Arrow = +1 = yang = object = the one in front of me to see directly = the outside = the numerator above
				- Circle = -1 = yin = subject = the one behind the scene = the inside = the denominator below
				- Equal = 0 = the Path (Dao) = the one in between = the ratio
				- Relativity of yin & yang: it's opposite in the extensional view, circle = yang = true, just, correct, complete = the form outside <> arrow = yin = false, missed/mistake, wrong/error, incomplete = the content inside

		- The Sustent = the self-sustained = the self-sustaining = the thing existing before, alongside (i.e. sustenance), and after (i.e. the sustained) the Extent
		  id:: 684c2e6e-f75f-4916-9f1c-4375d42d8604
			- Etymology: from Latin "sustentus" past participle of "sustinēre"
			- OED: "sustent" (archaic from 1664 to 67): That which sustains or supports.
			- How it's sustained: it's sustained by it's own parts, i.e. the content sustains the intent and vice versa.
			- The sustent is similar to the "substance" in philosophy, which is from "substāns" present participle of "substāre", and means "self-standing thing underlying all things". But there are diffs:
				- Sustent is actively maintaining itself, while the substance is just a dumb material for some subject (human or God) to attach attributes to make things.
				- Sustent includes at least 2 circles, while each substance is just one circle (the other[s] is the hands handling that substance).
				- Sustent is constantly changing, while substances are considered unchanged.
				- We may reuse the term "substance" with modified def "the one enduring changes while keeping a wholesome bundle of intrinsic properties called the 'natures' of it". The wholesomeness is subjective, i.e. relative to the viewpoint, and each substance is just a reflection of the intent circle.
		- All past participles of Latin verbs:
			- Sustent ~ sustentus <- sustain ~ sustinēre
			- Content ~ contentus <- contain ~ continēre
			- Intent ~ intentus <- intend ~ intendere
			- Extent ~ extentus <- extend ~ extendere

		- Bình Đẳng Tánh Trí (samatājñāna): Concrete Form = Content = constant
			- Form's intent = intensive/crystallized/intensional form = abstract form = Concrete Form / extent = Content/extent
			- Form's extent = extensive/covering/extensional form = concrete extension = Concrete Form * extent = Content*extent
		- Concrete form = const => 2 ways to manage its components via plimus & interunion:
			- 0. Tracking by abstraction: the trails contents combined = the circle of thread of the form
			- 1. Plimus for circle: Form's circular thread is a FIFO queue, i.e. amount of new content tracked = amount of old content forgot
			- 2. Interunion or onion layers: extent = b^n jumps between layers
		- uninet = onion of circles of form (path) that are crystallized from history of contents/signals in the past, and now direct/constrain/process contents/signals in the present, and then adapt/adjust/learn from contents/signals in the future.
			- For each node:
				- Affect (activation) = effect of afferent signal = (Thọ) Cảm Hoạt (受/感活, activation, Spinoza's affect/情動) with the rule "bổ tính tương hợp": a node is activated only when all its afferent branches have signal.
				- Effect (action) = effect of efferent signal = Hành (action) with the rule "đồng tính tương liên": effect distributed to efferent branches according to bandwidth (accumulated history) of these branches:
				- effect_on_branch[i] = bandwidth_of_branch[i] * amount_in_node
				- So, bandwidth of efferent branches are normalized to total sum = 1.
				- (Rendered mental) image = concrete extension of form = the whole view cone from that node
			- 3 circles: FIFO circle of form/memory, complementary circle of affect (world view), unit circle of effect (distribution of action)
			- Turing machine = uninet with
				- state graph (extensional) = cirefec = graph of forms/refs (intensional); state (stable/static/standing) = equilibrated effect circle; transition = equilibration
				- I/O head = obop
				- tape = sources and sinks of signal/content that cause effect circle to transform
			- ANN = uninet with
				- inputs = sources; expected outputs = sinks
				- layers of neurons = layers of onion from outside in
				- backpropagation ~ affect flow, is just a part of effect circle
				- attension = effect of meta (inner) nodes = affect of object nodes
