		- Eye-mind = obop = [ob] gap & link of the Circle = [op] director of the Arrow
			- The obop links 2 ends of the Arrow to be the Circle. This link is crucial to maintain the Circle, to store (concentrate) its energy.
			- Automatic = ob + auto-op = round Circle: machine, habit, karma. Its ob is just enough to maintain its Circle, but not enough to serve/do/execute larger plans => seems "dumb" to its boss.
			- Autonotic = auto-ob + auto-op = Circle that accepts disturbance/distortion from the external world and try to restore is roundness, like human, autonoton. Its ob not only looks outward to link its self (link 2 ends of the Arrow to be the Circle) but also looks inward to link with its director.
			- An autonoton, like human, cannot see itself but can only see its sub-autonotons, like moving hands, because its obop is dedicated to maintain its self/effect Circle.
				- In operation mode & external world observation mode, its effect circle is the large circle from the op through all components and back to the ob. So, its ob only sees the target image which is just the abstraction, the shortcut from the eye right to the object, hence cannot see its body (components).
				- In component observing mode, its effect circle is the small circle from the op to the object component and back to the ob. So the component can be seen but only for automatic components. The not well trained components cannot be observed because they're not automatic, i.e. their obops are still stuck to (shared with) the master obop.
		- Sleep = inactive = disconnected components: each component retracts to its own circle and doesn't communicate.
			- Wake = active = connected components: the effect flows through all (many) components to form the master circle. The effect propagates from one component circle to all its surrounding components like a wave.
			- Each component is activated by its input flows and maintained by the circle from its outputs back to its inputs.
				- => The master circle maintains & provides energy back to each component circle.
			- Imagination = internal image maintenance = the formation of master circles within the body in component observing mode: the master op activates some element components to project to an aggregate component/image and the master ob receive the effect from that image to close the master circle which effectively maintain the internal image.
			- In external obop mode, the internal images are automatically created to reflect the external world (passive imagination) and give map to direct itself to navigate in the external world. That map is equivalent to program/Turing-machine. But the diff is that the map of autonoton is constantly updated with the external world.
		- Hurt, pain, suffer = blockage, broken circle = inability of obop to connect & maintain its effect circle
		  <> Pleasure, bliss = throughness of the effect circle.
			- The mundane pleasure focus on the throughput (quantity) while the sublime bliss focus on the qualities like connectivity, integrity, roundness.
			  <~> Question = disconnected circle but with ability/willingness of obop to reconnect it via quest, problem solving, exploration, etc.
			- Right/true = the feedback effect to the ob matches so that the circle is connected.
			  <> Wrong/false = the feedback effect does not match the ob
			  ==> 2 ways to deal with this error:
				- ignore it, stick to the right, the connected circle in the past, i.e. avoid pain and seek pleasure => ignorance
				- solve it, using new facts to update the knowledge circle, i.e. raise question => learning

				- Positional: -1 - +1 - 0
			- extensional: 1 - 2 - ∞
				- intensional: 1 - 1/2 - 0 (dot ⋅)
				- dimensional: 2 - 1 - 0 (point ⋅)
				- complex: 1 - i - 0
		- philosophy & thread
			- extensional (ordinal, nominal), observed, analytic, zooming in: 1 circle = 2 (many) arrows = ∞ points
				- Circle = 1 = self = form
				- Arrow = 2 = contents (yin & yang) = any plural number (3, 4, ...)
				- Equal = ∞ = sensation; each point itself is a circle when zoom in...
			- intensional (discovered, positional), generated, synthesis, zoning out: start from a point, extend to a line, loops back to form a circle; zoom out to a point, then start the next dimension, etc.
				- Arrow = +1 = yang = object = the one in front of me to see directly = the outside = the numerator above
				- Circle = -1 = yin = subject = the one behind the scene = the inside = the denominator below
				- Equal = 0 = the Path (Dao) = the one in between = the ratio
				- Relativity of yin & yang: it's opposite in the extensional view, circle = yang = true, just, correct, complete = the form outside <> arrow = yin = false, missed/mistake, wrong/error, incomplete = the content inside

		- The Sustent = the self-sustained = the self-sustaining = the thing existing before, alongside (i.e. sustenance), and after (i.e. the sustained) the Extent
		  id:: 684c2e6e-f75f-4916-9f1c-4375d42d8604
			- Etymology: from Latin "sustentus" past participle of "sustinēre"
			- OED: "sustent" (archaic from 1664 to 67): That which sustains or supports.
			- How it's sustained: it's sustained by it's own parts, i.e. the content sustains the intent and vice versa.
			- The sustent is similar to the "substance" in philosophy, which is from "substāns" present participle of "substāre", and means "self-standing thing underlying all things". But there are diffs:
				- Sustent is actively maintaining itself, while the substance is just a dumb material for some subject (human or God) to attach attributes to make things.
				- Sustent includes at least 2 circles, while each substance is just one circle (the other[s] is the hands handling that substance).
				- Sustent is constantly changing, while substances are considered unchanged.
				- We may reuse the term "substance" with modified def "the one enduring changes while keeping a wholesome bundle of intrinsic properties called the 'natures' of it". The wholesomeness is subjective, i.e. relative to the viewpoint, and each substance is just a reflection of the intent circle.
		- All past participles of Latin verbs:
			- Sustent ~ sustentus <- sustain ~ sustinēre
			- Content ~ contentus <- contain ~ continēre
			- Intent ~ intentus <- intend ~ intendere
			- Extent ~ extentus <- extend ~ extendere

		- Bình Đẳng Tánh Trí (samatājñāna): Concrete Form = Content = constant
			- Form's intent = intensive/crystallized/intensional form = abstract form = Concrete Form / extent = Content/extent
			- Form's extent = extensive/covering/extensional form = concrete extension = Concrete Form * extent = Content*extent
		- Concrete form = const => 2 ways to manage its components via plimus & interunion:
			- 0. Tracking by abstraction: the trails contents combined = the circle of thread of the form
			- 1. Plimus for circle: Form's circular thread is a FIFO queue, i.e. amount of new content tracked = amount of old content forgot
			- 2. Interunion or onion layers: extent = b^n jumps between layers
		- uninet = onion of circles of form (path) that are crystallized from history of contents/signals in the past, and now direct/constrain/process contents/signals in the present, and then adapt/adjust/learn from contents/signals in the future.
			- For each node:
				- Affect (activation) = effect of afferent signal = (Thọ) Cảm Hoạt (受/感活, activation, Spinoza's affect/情動) with the rule "bổ tính tương hợp": a node is activated only when all its afferent branches have signal.
				- Effect (action) = effect of efferent signal = Hành (action) with the rule "đồng tính tương liên": effect distributed to efferent branches according to bandwidth (accumulated history) of these branches:
				- effect_on_branch[i] = bandwidth_of_branch[i] * amount_in_node
				- So, bandwidth of efferent branches are normalized to total sum = 1.
				- (Rendered mental) image = concrete extension of form = the whole view cone from that node
			- 3 circles: FIFO circle of form/memory, complementary circle of affect (world view), unit circle of effect (distribution of action)
			- Turing machine = uninet with
				- state graph (extensional) = cirefec = graph of forms/refs (intensional); state (stable/static/standing) = equilibrated effect circle; transition = equilibration
				- I/O head = obop
				- tape = sources and sinks of signal/content that cause effect circle to transform
			- ANN = uninet with
				- inputs = sources; expected outputs = sinks
				- layers of neurons = layers of onion from outside in
				- backpropagation ~ affect flow, is just a part of effect circle
				- attension = effect of meta (inner) nodes = affect of object nodes

				- complex: 1 - i - 0
		- philosophy & thread
			- extensional (ordinal, nominal), observed, analytic, zooming in: 1 circle = 2 (many) arrows = ∞ points
				- Circle = 1 = self = form
				- Arrow = 2 = contents (yin & yang) = any plural number (3, 4, ...)
				- Equal = ∞ = sensation; each point itself is a circle when zoom in...
			- intensional (discovered, positional), generated, synthesis, zoning out: start from a point, extend to a line, loops back to form a circle; zoom out to a point, then start the next dimension, etc.
				- Arrow = +1 = yang = object = the one in front of me to see directly = the outside = the numerator above
				- Circle = -1 = yin = subject = the one behind the scene = the inside = the denominator below
				- Equal = 0 = the Path (Dao) = the one in between = the ratio
				- Relativity of yin & yang: it's opposite in the extensional view, circle = yang = true, just, correct, complete = the form outside <> arrow = yin = false, missed/mistake, wrong/error, incomplete = the content inside

			- 1. closed self content c0 (perception screen)
			- 2. Constant ratio c0/i0 with the quantum intent i0
			  -> 1 total content, many different forms
			- 3. Uniform distribution of i_k in c_0
			  *) all are measured by the extent
			  **) the in-form is stable but not preserved: built up in learning & used up in working
		- Crystallization of content to form
			- round: symmetric crystal lattice
			- compressed: Large amount (extent) -> 1 (content) = 1 -> dot (intent) at the apex of the view cone
			- micro-defect (unround, unclosed) = size of intent = speed of being used up by carried contents
		- Circle equation: r^2 = e^2 + i^2
			- r^2 = size of r-complete graph = total energy
			- e^2 = size of extent-complete graph = potential energy = spatial energy between particles
			- i^2 = size of intent-complete graph = kinetic energy = temporal energy inside each particle
			  + Phase vector * dt = diagonal vector of dxdy in original xy graph
			  => Covering area = "length" of thread = energy

		- Levels of symmetry in CIE
			- intent (subject) <=[extent (interface)]=> content (object)
			- |intent| = |content| = |circle| = 1
			  content/intent = extent <=[holographic]=> extent^-1 = intent/content
			  => Complete graph => round

		- Space = place = stage = interface = .. boundary of the physical world 🌎 = the wall between material & mental world, between separate leaves and their common stem, between branches and their common base (origin, root)
			- on the stage of interaction, we cannot see neither the source (cause) of the interaction nor the working of interaction itself. We can only see the separation till they touch, till they reunite.
			- from the flat, round, smooth space of extent, i extend it into the spacetime by looking back inside: flat space > curved spacetime > wrinkled field > folded buddle/ball of thread... But it's too messy deep down there, no matter how many dimensions i use to spread it out.
			  => i abandon the spacetime (concrete form) to return it to the perfect flat space (abstract form) as a stage, a platform only, excluding it's contents (performers). The content is now a thread through both that space and time to go deep into the intent.
			  => The space now reduces to the simplest line segment [0..1], which is a container called "world" (previously i usually called it "form").
			  => The extent is now the "form", the skin of the actor/performer on that stage, expressed as a dot (not point) in that segment, which itself is the container of the intent.
			  => The intent is now the "body" of that actor which is the hidden content in that dot, which is another world, another space, in another dimension.
			  => The content (uncountable) is the thread throughout all of them, from the external space/world, through the skin of extent to the internal world of intent. Meanwhile, the "contents" (countable) of a world are all the actors in that world, including both form ("skin" extent) and "flesh" intent. The abstract contents are only the forms "skins".
			  => at the center of the space is the origin "0" which is the returning point for all actors in that world. The center of the intent body is the eye 👁️, the heart ❤️, the awareness of that body.
		- 2-step development of the bodies inside a world: twist & fold
			- twist = scissor = cut at the twisted point to produce 3 parts: the singularity (👁️, awareness) at the twisted point, 2 solitons (circles) cut from the source circle
			- twisting upside down = open the original circular space to form the hyperbolic space between the 2 new circles => projectivity that expands the 1 to the infinity ♾️
			- fold = neurulate = turning the singularity inside, from 1 mark on the circle into the center of the circle, from the eye to the heart & mind. This folding of the trilaminar embryo into the neutral tube is called "neurulation".
			- when the eye reaches the center, the body has become a complete world itself, i.e. matured.
			  => To reconnect to the root, just unfold inside out and untwist 😊
			- both twisting & folding are rotations

		- Mass - energy - information = circle - arrow - equal
			- the conservation laws of the 3 are just 1
			- center G of circular distribution = center of mass: sum of all vectors OX_k to its dots X_k [k = 1..m] = mass m * vector OG
				- in the view of O away form G, the close circle of thread is open by the vector m * OG
				- m * OG = time vector = trace in memory = self reflection which puts the image of the subject's self forward to be an object = "add 1 more layer of meta" in the construction of n-simplex (n-complete graph): [https://www.facebook.com/share/p/tzLKKdqEUGq9zuSc/](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/tzLKKdqEUGq9zuSc/)
			- complements: yin - yang = subject - object
				- vector(yin) + vector(yang) = 0 = center of awareness = heart = mind
				- amount(yin) + amount(yang) = 1 = capacity of memory; amount = length of thread = area of distribution
				- length(vector(yin)) = length(vector(yang))
				- exp(yin) = exp(yang) = term in Pascal's triangle
			- round thread circle = uniform distribution ... amount(yin) = amount(yang) = max entropy = classical mechanics = max action
			- circle thread of n segments:
				- extent = n = n phases
				- each segment has length of 1/n
				- exp = n^n forms of that thread
