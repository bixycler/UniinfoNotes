			- Normal people ‚Äúsurfing on the surface‚Äù, while meeting many incidences and accumulating emotions, their condenstates are not thick enough to interfere with their actions and decisions.
			- The ‚Äúthreshold people‚Äù have various subtle but deep feelings driving their life deep from within.
			- The role of normal people is to work, while the role of threshold people is to resolve the conflicts between these deep feelings.
		- Conscious breathing is the best way to release & resolve emotions.
			- With concetrated observation, the conscious breath can effectively cleanse and transform the underlying condensate.
			- My tendency is toward resolution more than releasing. It makes me suffer longer with attachments.

			- The materialistic version of ‚Äúex nihilo nihil fit‚Äù is [creatio ex materia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatio_ex_materia).
			- [Creatio ex nihilo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatio_ex_nihilo) is a doctrine in many religions.
		- The seemingly "nothing" is just the very thin substance that's invisible, just like the thin air, the gravitational field.
		- History
			- When reviewing for entrance exam to university, i uttered:
			  > There's no true/absolute vacuum!
			  > Kh√¥ng c√≥ ch√¢n kh√¥ng tuy·ªát ƒë·ªëi!
			- Returning home from JAIST, someday looking deep into the reality, i saw the "emptiness" is not empty at all, and the [≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ (Á©∫, Kh√¥ng)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81) is just the negation of the normal attachments. That moment i called Mr. Huy to share this insight.

		- Etymology
			- Seems that ‚Äúinto thin air‚Äù was [popularized by Shakespeare](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/into_thin_air#Etymology) first (1500s), then ‚Äúout of thin air‚Äù came later (1830s) as an opposite.
			- idioms.online: [Meaning of Idiom ‚ÄòOut of Thin Air‚Äô](https://www.idioms.online/out-of-thin-air/)
			  > The antonym, into thin air, has been used since at least the 1500s. Out of thin air has been used since at least the 1830s.
			  > Thin air, in this idiom, refers to the air in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, a location that was mysterious and unknown at the time this idiom originated.

		- ((6675369a-1d13-48c5-8a77-d588aa8b59b8)) can be naturally refined to $2^t$, while radix numbers are difficult to be refined (built for extension, not for refinement)
			- Radix fraction, e.g. $10^{-n}$, is inverse extension, i.e. intension (negative extension), not refinement
		- intension refinement = extension expanding

					- The half of Ôªølogarithm of [binomial coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient) approaches the [binary entropy function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_entropy_function) $H_b$ in base $e^2$, as $n$ approaches infinity, which is very close to an arc of a perfect circle.
						- Binomial coefficient $$ B{\binom{n}{k}} $$ = $$ C_k^n $$ = number of k-combinations of n, and [beta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_function) B(p, q):
						  $$ B{\binom{n}{k}} = \frac{n!}{k! \cdot (n-k)!} = \frac{(n+1)^{-1}}{\Beta(k+1, n-k+1)} $$
						- Normalized log of binomial: ($x = k/n$)
						  $$ lB_n(x)=\frac{\ln(B\binom{n}{xn})}{n} $$
						- $lB$ approaches $H_b$ in base $e$ as $n$ approaches infinity:
						  $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty }lB_n(x) = 
						  H_b(x) = -(x \cdot \ln(x) + (1-x) \ln (1-x)) $$
						- Half of $lB$ approaches $H_{bs}$ ($H_b$ in base $e^2$) as $n$ approaches infinity:
						  $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty } \frac{1}{2} lB_n(x) = 
						  H_{bs}(x) = -\frac{1}{2} (x \cdot \ln(x) + (1-x) \ln (1-x)) $$

							- ![Binomial-Log-Entropy-Circle.png](../assets/geometry/Binomial-Log-Entropy-Circle.png){:height 539, :width 505}
						- Distributions
							- In [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution)Ôªø of a fair coin, $X$ ~ $B(n, p=1/2)$, the probability of getting exactly $k$ heads in $n$ independent [Bernoulli trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial) is the ratio between the number of $k$-combinations and the total number of combinations $2n$:
							  $$ Pr[X = k] =  \frac{B\binom{n}{k}}{2^n} = B_d(n, k) = B_d(x) [x = \frac{k}{n}] $$
							- When $n$ approaches infinity, this distribution approaches the [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)¬†$N(Œº=n/2, œÉ^2=n/4)$, and its probability mass function $B_d(x)$, normalized by scaling both axes by $\sqrt n$ and centering to 1/2, approaches the probability mass function $œÜ(x| Œº=0, œÉ=1/2)$ of the fair normal distribution $N(Œº=0, œÉ^2=1/4)$:
							  $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty } {\sqrt n} B_d( \frac{x}{\sqrt n} + \frac{1}{2} ) = œÜ(x | Œº=0, œÉ=\frac{1}{2}) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} e^{-2 x^2} $$
							- ![Binomial-Log-Distribution.png](../assets/geometry/Binomial-Log-Distribution.png)
						- Derivatives
							- Derivative of the binary entropy function $H_b$ is the negative of [logit function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit) which is the inverse function of [logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function). 
							  $$ dH_b(x) = -\ln(x) + \ln(1-x) = - \ln(\frac{x}{1-x}) = - logit(x) $$
							- Its second order derivative is the negative reciprocal of the [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map).
							  $$ ddH_b(x) = \frac{-1}{x‚ãÖ(1-x)} $$
							- The logistic map $x‚ãÖ(1-x)$ is the core form of [beta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_function):
							  $$ B(p,q) = \int_0^1 x^p (1-x)^q dx $$
				- This arc is the distribution of (entropy = log of numbers) of thousand-bit words whose weight (number of 1s) equals k: k = 1 -> 1000 from left to right. The (entropy = log of numbers) of all thousand-bit words is (N = 1000) which is normalized to 1 (= N/N) in this circle plot. This entropy distribution is the log of [binomial distribution via convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle#Relation_to_binomial_distribution_and_convolutions).

			- With [the abstraction of body and extraction of head](((66669d80-3648-415c-b426-e8105cf6ef80))), a circle can refer to its sub-circles using heads of sub-circles.
			- In the collapsed/folded view, the content of a circle is just  
			  `[context] before a [head] and after it`
				- In the expanded/unfolded view, that content becomes  
				  `[context] before a [head](body of the sub-circle) and after it`
				- Words in the context can be either other sub-circles' heads, i.e. keywords, or global non-key words (prepositions) whose content is not closed in a concrete circle but open to the collection of all contexts using them.
				- These prepositions can have descriptions, or even definitions, but their true definition is the whole extension of contexts using them. That means a preposition can only be "understood" but cannot be transcluded (embedded, expanded, unfolded).
					- These prepositions are "atoms" of the system, when the whole system is expanded/unfolded, the "raw thread" is nothing but a chain of prepositions, as component arrows.
		- In a tree system, the path from root to a blob, i.e. the chain of heads of circular blobs, is the path/address of that blob, and the collection of all addresses create a branch system, an address space, a view cone.
		  id:: 6667d217-5269-4a34-8863-7fbb46e91ecc
			- The prepositions can be viewed as heads of circles in a meta-space outside of this address space, hence they cannot be unfolded within this space and can only be understood (unfolded) in the meta-space.

		- The part of content that "i don't care" (body) is abstracted, the remaining brief is called "head", "name", "key", etc. That head is further shortened [from the lengthy context to address, to name and to id](((66600918-ed92-40c9-bda5-1911865d676c))).
		- Now, in the view of the subject, that part is just a name, a symbol, a ref, a form, which can further be renamed, transformed into different forms to fit subjective views. E.g. the local name, local variable is the transformed name of the address.
		- In the subjective view, a concise name can be expanded into the content of the named object via many forms of embedding: (parenthesis), clauses like `which`, `where`, etc.
		- The name is the link between the named ((667cfa42-ade7-4310-9a7b-6d14d01c16da)) and the name using ((667cfa3e-9856-43f0-956b-ebb4ff31d8eb)).
			- In ((667cfa42-ade7-4310-9a7b-6d14d01c16da))'s side, the name is its abstraction.
			- In ((667cfa3e-9856-43f0-956b-ebb4ff31d8eb))'s side, the name is a part of the subject's content.
			- Hence, the name is an interface of the ((667cfa42-ade7-4310-9a7b-6d14d01c16da)) for the ((667cfa3e-9856-43f0-956b-ebb4ff31d8eb)) to use.

				- Properties:
				  collapsed:: true
					- `case-sensitive::``true` (default = false) adds `(?i)` to the main pattern
					- `whole-word::``true` (default = false) adds `\b` to the main pattern
					- `filter::` the regex pattern that result blocks must match, in **conjunction** with the main pattern
					- `child-filter::` the regex pattern that at least on child block (if any) must match, in **disjunction** with filter pattern
					- Filter combinations:
						- An empty filter, e.g. `filter::` means "everything is allowed" which is different from lacking such filter whose meaning depends (see next...)
						- When **no filters** appear, the search domain includes **all blocks**.
						- When at least one filter appears, the search domain includes the **disjunction** of appearing filters.
							- An empty `child-filter::` means "blocks with at least one child are allowed".
							- An empty `filter::` means "all blocks are allowed", ignoring `child-filter::`.
							- To disable a filter, instead of removing that filter, we can use *contradiction patterns* like `$^` or `(nothing)^` as a placeholder.
								- Note: Don't set both `filter:: (nothing)^` and `child-filter:: (nothing)^` because it makes the search domain empty!

		  It's simpler just to use sub-items to store properties. Then in the property `components` of the container item, we can collect forms (definitions) of these sub-item-properties into a list, like this:

			- In the top-down view, Will's ex-world can be partitioned by region, e.g. `Vietnam/house of Will/Na` vs `Japan/house of Harusada/Na`.

			- The backslash is used in [MS-DOS/Windows' path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#MS-DOS/Microsoft_Windows_style), in [PHP namespace](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php), and as¬†[Decimal Exponent Symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation "Scientific notation") in¬†[ALGOL 68](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_68 "ALGOL 68").

	- The relativity & equality between form & content as 2 vectors

	  collapsed:: true
		- `u‚ãÖv = 0` means orthogonal... but their "self threads" are parallel!?!
		- The portion of seen is the portion of orthogonal => parallel = unseen
		- We see a static object, which is almost parallel to us in time, thanks to the near orthogonal light rays from it! That's why we can only see its external shape, i.e. very little part of it.
	- All objects are arrows, addresses, vector, `v`'s
	  id:: 6772a6c9-4a1a-46b6-9981-df8f8a9ae39b
	  collapsed:: true
		- Relativity: The destination of that address is relative to the root object (intent, self).
		- The root object `O` is just another vector, hence the target of `v` from `O` is just `O+v`.
		- `v` is the diff, the change, the transformation, the effect brought to `O`.
		- Intensionally, it's the addition `O+v`, but extensionally it's the multiplication `O‚ãÖv`.
	- **Id < *address* < context**  
	  id:: 66600918-ed92-40c9-bda5-1911865d676c
	  collapsed:: true
	  All content arrow is via its complement context:   
	  full content = apparent content carried by the form + hidden content (context as form)
		- form = condensed context = condensed hidden content
		- optimization = formation = context condensation (to the extremes like id)
		  + optimization frees the subject from the lengthy "irrelevant" context, but also constrains to the form!
	- In possessive form like "Will's note", [the apostrophe `'` stands for](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/history-and-use-of-the-apostrophe) the "e" in the suffix "-es" of [genitive form](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/genitive) of noun in the [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English).

		- Now I propose to use apostrophe to further omit the "s" in possessive form, so

			- `Will/mind/conceptual/head` in file management =
