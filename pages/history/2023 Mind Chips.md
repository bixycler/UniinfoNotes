		- Remainder = error = the wrong = content <> Module = the right = form
			- formation = remainders' collection & condensation
			- protocol = following the modules & put remainders aside to be collected inside of each self circle
			- observation = collecting remainders via sampling by modules = rolling in = folding
			- operation (action) = decision = output a form crystallized from remainders = rolling out = unfolding
			- freewill = the invisibility & independence of remainders inside

		- iBuddy (iBồ) vs Apple's i-products:
			- uninet: intelligent/intellectual (AGI, thông minh), imaginary/illusory (ảo), intuitive (trực quan, sinh động), interactive/interconnected (tương quan, tương tác), intent (mindful vs extent, chăm chú, tập trung), interest/interesting (quan tâm, chú ý, thú vị), integrity/integral (nhất quán, toàn vẹn), ideal (lý tưởng)
			- Apple: internet, individual, instruct, inform, inspire
				- Steve Jobs first introduced the iMac in 1998: [https://youtu.be/0BHPtoTctDY](https://youtu.be/0BHPtoTctDY)

		- Lubrication ~ liberation: connected, continuous, smooth, through, non-blocking
			- from the lucid dream this morning: 2 parts of the thread (ROM & RAM) seem not connected (only modify RAM) but actually, when sleeping, ROM is modified by the results from RAM.
				- They are not only connected but circularly connected
				- Problems, diseases are due to the fragmentation of activated parts in the thread ==> first focus on the unactivated chunks then keep activated throughout the thread.
				- Lay people without problems have just a short chunk of activation at the surface but continuous, hence a flying arrow > Problematic people have deeper chunks of activation but disconnected > Liberated people have a circular connected activation, hence a rolling wheel.
			- from the ohm-thread: the "circular" link is the Intent in CIE. The reflection ex-in just projects the closed Circle ⭕ of Content to the open Arrow of Extent (open to infinity ♾️), but actually the infinities are connected together by the Intent.
				- Intent is the pole & center of protection in the stereographic projection.
				- While 0 is the external neutral point (center of the object), ♾️ is the internal neutral point (center of the subject).
				- The Content seems to be an open Arrow (the Wrong, the energy) just because the Intent (the Right, the form) is abstracted from it.
				- The Intent is abstracted by virtue of the black box Self/Ego
				- The linearity of Quantum Mechanics is due to the ε-abstraction of the intent then ω-extension of the content to infinities => perturbation theory & renormalization are required

		- Linear = on the same projection line through the eye = projected to the same point (index, extent) on the screen = abstracted to a point & extended to a line = [dynamic] vary under the same function (transformation, flow, current, distribution, projection), AKA function-linearity = similar, have the same ratio c/i (e) in CIE
			- CIE = inversive geometry = projective geometry = reflection of content <🪞> extent by the intent as a projection ray or radius in concentric model = on the same straight line in orthogonal model
				- concentric model: arc (c) = radius (i) * angle (e): [projective] fixing angle e, arc c ~ radius i; [linear] fixing radius i, angle e ~ arc c
				- Orthogonal model: y (c) = [linear] k (i) * x (e) = [projective] x (i) * a (e)
				- View cone via interunion: the cone's body (1, ∞) is reflected into the top (0, 1) which are similar but inverse
				- In-ex Relativity: Operation i*e is just the observation of the World against the Mine through the content c;
				- Real-imaginary Relativity: scaling of radius ~ rotation of angle ==> repeat of scale range (0, ∞) [ε, ω] via **circular reflection **(recursion, interaction) = scale invariant = power law = holographic principle
			- [linear] **dependency** = inner product = scaling factor of the image of the object in the subject's eye = force = **curvature** = 1/exp(i) = **1/exp(distance)**
				- Independence = straight (∞ radius) = zero curvature = orthogonal (i = ∞)
	- 2023-01-28
		- Form & Content in CIE: c = total (diagonal) content; i = form = crystallized (base) content; i*frac(e) = carried (constrained) content < i; i*int(e) = directive (free) content
			- the vector i*e:
				- root (tail) = the base i = kernel = ε = 0;
				- body = displacement = the directive content i*int(e) = index 👉 = extent = direction;
				- head = the carried content i*frac(e) = remainder = error = differential; head (nearly)// root ⊥ body.
			- spirorus current view: form i = tube = circular current; directive content = the current flowing in the tube ⊥ the crystallized current of the tube
				- the crystallized current cancels contents in the base dimension ==> constraints the carried content & shields it from external content in this dimension ==> leaves it free in the directive dimension, eg. light polarizer
		- Ratio extents based on i0 = ε: Totality = c/ε, intensity = i/ε, extensity = ε/i = 1/intensity
			- Universal ratios for i0 = c: Totality := c/c = 1; intensity := i/c = 1/e; extensity := c/i = e; intensity * extensity = totality = 1;
			  Displacement (distance) := log(ratio extent): universal total displacement = 0 = intensive distance + extensive distance
			- view distance = view angle = angle between base circle & direction arrow = log(intensity)
				- Orthogonal view = ∞ view: body ⊥ (head // base), they are independent due to the separation by the ∞ wall
			- apparent (external) distance = log(directive content / c), used in continued fraction
			- hidden (internal) distance = log(carried content / c) = view distance of the next order diff (in Euclidean algorithm)

		- Autonoton's current of i/o, ob/op:
			- observation = analysis of external object by various eyes => holographically diverge 1 to many images
			- operation = synthesis of various internal images into an action => converge
			- types of operation: storing (absorption, learning, memorizing, compression), reaction, releasing (xả, output in refined form of energy)
				- storing & releasing seem "pure observation" but opposite in output
				- Reflection = reaction + releasing = filtered reaction
			- in middle view, ob & op are just 2 opposite arrows with the same nature: projection between worlds, being n-n (double wedge/cone) in general, or 1-n or n-1 (wedge/cone)
		- Emotion = measure of (+/-): con/destructiveness of Circle, through/blocking-ness of Arrow
			- emotion directs both learning and (re)action => used in training and controlling
		- Views:
			- subjective view = of This subject (eye)
			- (relatively) middle view = of the smallest of This subject
			- relative view = of any subject
			- (relatively) objective view = of the greatest (but very small) common eye of all subjects; no absolute objectivity; ~ middle view
			- holistic view = integration all views from all eyes at all scales
		- Free Will = independence = randomness = orthogonality = intrinsic black box of the self (oboper) = unlimited refinability of the oboper
	- 2023-02-01
		- Universe = Life = Ohm-current = Ohm-thread 🧵
			- its cross section = space = form, which moves along time => transform, motion, rotation, procedural programming, physics
			- its longitudinal section = time = content, which captures relations => mapping, function, projection, arrow, circle, functional programming, maths (category theory)
			- transformation = projection = mapping = lens = eye 👁️ = distortion = (high order) curvature: all forms, AKA "states", are distorted image of the universal form Circle ⭕ through eyes, then they are transformed by the rolling of these eyes (rotation of the eyeball circle)
	- 2023-02-09
		- CIE = content2extent by intent = abstraction by cancellation = projection by light ray = mapping by function = transformation by time
			- Abstraction: the Circle (intent, light, function, time) is abstracted away because its opposite arrows cancel each other
				- It's hidden in the microcosm => revealed in orders of differential (time, velo, acceleration,...)
				- These hidden dimensions are equivalent to the visible dimensions (image, extent/index space) in relaxed view
			- Orthogonality: intent ⊥ extent by def. by the virtue of cancellation (p - n = |p| + |n| <=> diff/sim = 1)
				- Orthogonal basis (relativity): the rectangle p×n is square iff |p| = |n| <=> |p/n| = 1; for arbitrary circle (p+n = 0), in its intrinsic (relaxed) view it's square ⬜ (p + n = 0 <=> |p/n| = 1) and it sees the external square (grid) as a rectangle elongated by ratio |p/n|
				- Criteria: for arbitrary pair of vector (p, n), diff/sim = 1 <=> p ⊥ n, combined with |p/n| = 1 yields square p×n.
			- Linearity: the line = intent circle = cancellation line = projection/light ray = function arrow = time arrow = world line = self line = self circle ⭕
				- The scalar extent (distance) between 2 points (c, i) on that line = (tang of) angle between them in the circle = cross ratio e = (c, i; 0, ∞) = the scalar in linear algebra c = i*e
		- Relative views vs relaxed view
			- Relativity: to me I'm Circle (intensive) you're Arrow (extensive) <> to you you're Circle (intensive) I'm Arrow (extensive)
			- Relaxation (=): we're all the same thread 🧵 folding/contacting to Circle and unfolding/expanding to Arrow.

		- CIE = inversive geometry = observation (inverse of operation) = reflection = "rooting" = root finding (of equation) = inverse functioning = finding inverse/backward function from the forward function = finding the Yin (-) from the Yang (+) in the Circle [Yin + Yang = 0]
			- subtraction, division, (log & root0) are inverse of addition, multiplication, exponentiation ==> roots of unity bridge Trigonometry & Algebra.
			- Euclidean (continued) division, Newton's method are algorithms of finding root using sequence of **approximation refinement** ==> general sequence jumping between f & g for finding incidence point (eye) of them = observing, zooming into the eye of incidence.
		- Physics -> Proj Geometry -> Trigonometry -> Algebra -> Arithmetic
	- 2023-02-17
		- Constraints = equation = intent/form/circle of the eye 👁️ (eyeball)
			- view x with reference frame i = transform x to satisfy the constraints i(x) = 0, eg. shift to origin (x - O), scale to unit (x/u), rotate to orthogonal/diagonal
			- dependency = inner product = gcd(m, n) => two rotations:
				- Orthogonalize: set the smaller n := gcd(m, n)
				- Diagonalize: n := m - gcd(m, n)
	- 2023-02-19
		- Stitch (of thread) = info preserving transformation, mapping
			- plimus = linear shift in tangent space (c, d)->(c+d, c-d) = white box module function = sequential action of dependent modules = arrow
			- interunion = CIE = analysis (c, i)->(gcd, lcm, c/gcd) = observation = nonlinear rotation in polar space = black box module function = parallel action of independent modules = circle ⭕
				- inverse of interunion = operation = synthesis 3->2
			- ToP = circular triple rela Equal^Arrow\Circle = Obop^Content\Form = Obop: Content -> Form = meta CIE = exp = function = mapping from Arrow to Circle = Equal = encapsulate content wave into form particle => the black-box-ness of the circle makes the image parallel, orthogonal, independent, multiplicative
		- Turing machine uses one-way (info non-preserving) function, linear/sequential operation (ops in radix system), constant knowledge (radix, base), synthesis 3->2. Uninet uses two-way stitch, base-free sequential obop (Euclidean, interunion) + parallel obop (Chinese remainder) to analyze input (observe, learn new knowledge).
			- uninet is to Turing machine as residue number system (& continued fraction) is to radix number system
			- holographic: 1 thread (number) is observed by N eyes (modules, circles, dividers, analysers) parallelly, at the surface N remainders are enough for info of the source thread (RNS), but each eye does analyse the whole input into a continued fraction => each eye has a whole but different image of the thread => the memory is distributed everywhere like a hologram!
				- Short term memory ~ momentum = single circle; long term memory ~ force field configuration = multiplayer circles recursively reflect 1 input circle into an intricate fractal
			- holism: holographic (all in one, one in all), projective, relative, relaxed
		- Logistic function = projective metric = combine both exponential (geometric, space, parallel, polar) growth at 2 poles + linear (arithmetic, time, sequential, tangent) growth in the middle = 1/(1 + e^-t)
			- linear = balance of 2 opposite poles (0 <> ∞) = arrow
			- exponential (ratio r) = circle around a pole (curvature k = log r)
			- projective between 2 poles ε & ω: p(t) = (x_t, u; ε, ω) =[ε=0, ω=∞]=> exponential from pole 0 (inversive reflect about u): p(t) = x_t/u (ratio 1/u) =[u=1,p=exp,ln(0)=-∞]=> linear reflect about ln(u)=ln(1)=0: t = ln(x_t)
			- 2 relativities: between 2 poles ε ~ ω via ∞ push/pulling, between pole/point/eye and polar/line/circle ε ~ u via log
			- projective/exp/linear = bi/mono/non-polar
			- distortion of image vs source object in projection due to inversion = dependent vs independent vars = extent vs intent = high order vs low order digits = exp(x) vs x = y vs ln(y) = extrinsic vs intrinsic metrics = pole point vs polar line/circle = curvature of eyeball circle vs straight line = force for restoring to the (relaxed) linear distribution
		- a = b <=> a - b = 0 <=> a/b = 1

		- **Holistic momentum** = const-sized ($mc^2$) vector = momentum vector (in space) + energy vector (= momentum in time)
			- **i=√-1 derived from dynamics**: velocity reflected at the wall must pass through 0 but total momentum is preserved => the whole momentum vector must pokes out of space dimension => space × momentum = phase space:
			  id:: 684c282f-07d0-4f39-b8b0-b7514ba1b135
				- The eigenvector of diff is exp() => extended to phase space: x' = p & p' = x => x'' = x => √1 = negative (opposite) unit «-1»; x' = -p & p' = x => x'' = -x => √-1 = imaginary (internal, intensive) unit «i»;
				- The loop of derivatives in phase space complex plane contains 4 units (+1, +i, -1, -i), ie. x'''' = x => to be extended to quaternion
			- the momentum dimension p in phase space is the folded (intensified) of time => spacetime = extended phase space => energy = momentum in time => force = curvature = density of energy = tightness of circle = how much motion in time
				- Pythagorean theorem <== circle in phase space ==> everything is circle
		- Differentials (high order) = orthogonal radix numerals = Turing machine vs uninet = holographic numerals = diagonal multimodular numerals (RNS & continued fraction)
		  ==> this defines the computation inside the Quantum => geometry => physical laws
	- 2023-02-23
		- (unit) circle ⭕ from spirals & spiral from circles: oscillating, touching, synergy, moire pattern, lattice, multimodular

		- **Possibilities (of configurations) = states**;
			- space = container of possibilities;
			- probability = density of possibility in space;
			- information = object (vector, number) = encoding of config into the thread of self ⭕️;
			- entropy = amount of info = log(number of configs);
			- function = transformation of number (info) = traversal of obop in space = distribution of actual configs in the space of possible configs = mapping actualities (foreground time) against possibilities (background space) = projection of object's worldline onto subject's space;
			- dimension = division/modularization of space (from 1 thread into many threads);
			- time = actualization/computation of configs to object (number)
	- 2023-03-02
		- Power series (weight = coefficient): radix numbers: base = number; derivative based state of a dynamic point: base = d; Taylor series: base = (x-x0); Fourier series: base = exp(i*pi*t)
			- ANN = network of weighted series with implicit power via depth (number of players), base = activation function (logistic)
	- 2023-03-05
		- 2 types of refinement: **extensional refinement** (Turing machine) + **intensional refinement** (uninet)
			- ex.refine: extension, add (intent to) content, multiply extent, synthesis, action
			- in.refine: abstraction, subtract (intent from) content, divide intent, analysis, observation: extract the sim, the knowledge to create new abstractions, new concepts, new views (perspectives)
	- 2023-03-22
		- ### Thread -> Number --[diff/dynamic]--> Geometry (vector, dir/dimension)
			- Roots of unity: d^n(x) = xdt <=> j = n√1
			- Hyperbolic (n=2, j = √1 = -1): dy/dx = -y/x <=> xydt = xdy = -ydx <=> xy = c <=> x = e^t & y = e^-t
				- xydt = +-area => area conservation
			- Elliptic (n=4, j = √-1 = i): dy/dx = -x/y <=> xydt = xdx = -ydy <=> x^2 + y^2 = R^2 <=> x = cos(t) & y = sin(t)
				- xydt = (area) projected on x or y => length conservation
				- **Prj onto x [content = xydt = xdx = extent * intent]**: the intent ydt is abstracted/folded into dx which is then abstracted to 1(ε) in external view
				  => only the extent x is visible
				  => the intent dx = ydt reflects the complement content of the extent
				  => the exchange content (between ex & in) xydt is integrated to the total content R^2 = relations/interactions between elements in R
		- ### 3 roles of number: time arrow (ord) - space arrow (id) = spacetime circle (card)
			- time arrow = tangent arrow = order = history = calculation = deduction chain (proof)
			- space arrow = polar/radius/radiant arrow = index/identity = now = result = QED = projected/abstracted time arrow
				- space arrow is encrypted into number (object, tree, vector)
			- spacetime circle = knowledge circle = cardinality/size
				- projected onto space as space circle = view circle

		- The absolute id/address absolutely identifying an object in the absolute space... is an illusion about apparent id!
		  ==> **Holistic id** = full address = the whole self/intension
			- My id = my self = all of my intension circles
				- Apparent id = name, id number, appearance, ... as well as internal self def, ideals, desire, purpose, ...
			- Object id = my image of that object = intension circle of that object
				- Apparent id = target = intention = verifier/witness/decider/recognizer of the object = know-what
				- Holistic id = full circle of knowledge (how-what-why-self) = the whole process circle of searching and questing for its meaning
				  <== The apparent id seems to be absolute because its space is so vast and fundamental.
				  <== The illusion of a self as an independent particle: hard constraints/commands in IT, attachments in life
		- ==> Relax the particle into a bundle of circles (Einstein's General Relativity)
			- The tangent point between circles (via zoom-in) = the eye (thức) = linear & uniform = the **here-now** = the **actor/generator** of extent by mixing intents (intent & content)
			- The meta/upper world/view is constructed by zoom-out, by combining more points = higher derivatives = higher curvatures = complex forms, rules, force, feeling... but then compressed into the center of the self particle via **inversive reflection** (inner most <=> outer most) = the imaginary/meta/virtual/abstract = **connection** past-future, there-other (そこ • あそこ).
		- ==> The life's search & quest = the extension process via multiplying intents (intent & content)
			- Constantly update the self: update intentions, purposes, target, defs, knowledge, via observation
				- Machine (pre-AI) = no update of the self due to high density of physical particles.
				- Living organisms try to preserve the inner self (core) by constantly update the peripheral components.
			- Constantly update the world via extent resulted from actions.
				- This actually update the bigger self (of the world).
	- 2023-05-04
		- Circle (diff) equation: content(dS) = xdx = -ydy = extent(x) * intent(dx) = the image of the world (x) in the view of subject(dx)
			- Two projections (forms) xdx = -ydy of the same content dS are exchanged (between x & y) and integrated into 2 images of R^2 on Ox and Oy
			  ==> two types of conservation:
				- spatial/multiplicative conservation of states/possibilities (xdx = -ydy) in the quantum, also the equivalence/relativity of views, also the conservation of content (of exchange) which generates Metric
				- temporal/squared-additional conservation of energy (x^2 + y^2 = R^2), also the constant velocity of light (c), also the conservation of form (Circle) via Norm (length) which makes things rigid, stable, discrete, quantumic, orthogonal, which generates returning force
	- 2023-05-08
		- Inversion of control (IoC): only control/change one's self
			- Controller = head = heart = center = top = representative of the Circle of Self ==> Control the bigger self, not "outsider"
		- Setter++: Not a place to be set by other passively, but `this` actively look for "consumer/labor wanted" `that` and make conversation with `that` to accomplish the "setting" task on `this`.
		- Demigods are afraid of other's Circle due to the freedom, autonomy, uncontrollability of the Circle, e.g. non-stop recursion, circular dependency, race condition, dead lock, etc.
			- There must be a top representative to control the circle, to refine it (refine down to 0 means to stop, to brake it), or to drive it (after it reach full solidity).
			- Each iteration is a step of refinement (down) or consolidation (up). The accidents of control lost is due to no/lost track of consolidation, resulting from no or malfunctioning top + all bottoms are given full power (as the top).
			- Refinement <> consolidation is the interactive/returning force between tops and bottoms. When there's no individual top, the "top soul" is the liquid flowing through out bottoms.

		- The way of Form:
			- Formation: The (1-way) Arrow flows into a point to concentrate content into form; the other way around is hidden due to its diversity;
			- Constraint: The form use its huge force to constrain other contents flow in one direction, prevent them flowing the other direction ==> 1-way arrow ==> formation ==> meta circle of Form
			- Equilibrium: The form "self" constantly direct its flows i/o to maintain its circle state of eq.
		- All Maths and IT are built around the Form, from the precise "point" to formal logic of true/false and to discrete info 0/1 with 1-way control in IT.
			- Maths sacrifice all content of a circle to collapse it into a contentless "point";
				- Equations are formulae of perfect circle states to find the equilibrium answers which are pure forms without content (errors, disturbance);
			- Logic flip-flop implement formal logic of true/false, 0/1 by elongate the span of a state (form) to very much longer than a transition (content) to ensure a stable value (extent) ==> deform the circle into a long dipole 0<———————>1;
			- Program cut the eye off the circle of effect to form the pipe of 1-way "function" from input to output; that eye is reserved to human (programmer) who close the circle behind the scene, behind even the knowledge/consciousness of the controller/programmer him/herself!
			  ==> Just reconnect the micro circles, the macro circles will emerge!
	- 2023-05-26
		- refinement = self reflection = introspection = autonotion
			- When one meet, a problem, a failure, like a dead end or a deadlock or a vicious circle or a lostness (of way or target), one needs to look back into one's self to refine that circle of self into finer circles ==> increase freedom (possibility space) ==> open the way out.
				- [(Dead end, deadlock), (lostness, vicious circle)] = too much [constrained, free](arrow, circle) ==> find the [freedom, constraint] deeper in one's self.
			- The Turing machine can see outside object, and its data but cannot see its code; The reflection API is for external entity (programmer & external object), not for itself.
			- Looking back into itself, one breaks its clear & precise form down into fuzzy & vague content... not to end up in vagueness, but to merge that content with unprocessed data/issues to make it clearer, to formulate it into new forms. That ability of integrating new data from unknown knowledge, AKA "failure", into one self's knowledge is called wisdom.

		- Thread representations:
			- Tangent circles ~ temporal linear (hyper)box, concentric circles ~ spatial linear box ~ rotating vectors ~ sin/cos waves, longitudinal waves ~ phase - space linear box ~ phase spiral
		- Holographic = Sampling = quantization = circling = unlimited dimensionalism
			- Continuous = infinitesimal sampling
			- Phase transition = reaching quantum (circle) size
			- All conservation laws (content = intent x extent = const) are just reflections of the too small quantum eye; Reaching the size of that micro eye, the corresponding conservation breaks.
			  => All structures and topologies are preserved by some micro eyes. Passing that micro size, the id, self, structure, topo will break down and resolve into the whole which will be restructured and emerge as new structures of the underlying layer of reality.
			  => The rotation of the micro eye, AKA "viewing in diff angles" projects itself into various forms of the extensional world => every transformation is a kind of rotation + projection
			- The effect flow from this rotation to that rotation is the dynamics of the world, which flow in all directions: between micro & macro, between the same level
			- The sizes (micro/macro) are just relative to the self (eyeball) due to sampling & moiré effect: when circle A see a smaller circle B, A just see an abstraction (sampling, projection) of B; when A dives into B to see more, it's diving into itself with different perspective/dimension, because both A & B are just 2 manifestations of the same Universal circle Ohm.
			  => The Ohm thread is usually represent by a 1D line but it's dimensionless, holographic, which can be extended to infinite dimensions. The "1D line" is just a projection.

		- Phase sync is to autonoton as function call is to (procedural) programming.

			- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillatory_neural_network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillatory_neural_network)
			- Coupled (driven) oscillator, circle map, Arnold tongue, Kuramoto model
			- Function call/invocation = sync I/O of the Turing Machine head = full phase-locking = equilibrium = clear cut arrow/circle = excluding the third
	- 2023-06-14
		- Produce - Conduce - Reduce / product - conduct(behavior) - reduct(result)
			- Predicative maths: all functions (arrows, roads, forms) are already there, the executor (runner, wheel, content) just follows that road from source to dest ==> No production nor reduction, just execution (conduction)
			- Computer function: the network of functions is laid out from the init function ==> Produce then execute without reduction
			- Computer procedure:
				- Development phase: the constructor/generator produce connections, extend the state space, via objects & vars ==> the form is formed
				- Working phase: upon that form, the content is conduced via many mini & micro produce-reduce (call-return), like call stack ==> the content fills in the form until its full, the grand arrow extended to reach the ultimate goal
				- Returning phase: reaching the goal, the functions return in cascade and reduce into its result (return value)
			- In collections: map-reduce = produce-reduce
			- In radix number systems: zeros are form/space for ones (non-zeros) as contents to be produced in increment, then at the end when all space is filled (with the highest non-zero), the cascade of reduction to the "1" of next position occur
			- In D*:
				- Produce: all forms from basic types, interfaces, constraints, to functions, vars, objects are produced in cascade
				- Conduce: upon the set up forms, the contents flow with their own produce/reduce; their continuous produce-reduce creates the "rolling effect".
				- Reduce: reaching the sync, the saturate contents reduce/crystallize into a new form at the higher place, as a "reduct/result".
				  ==> The reduct is a dried/empty shell/form that is thirsty for contents to fill in, because all contents have been expelled in the process of reduction. ==> The intrinsic craving, greed, of the forms.
		- Reprocon (RPC) - CIE - ObOp (FoC) - Refinement
			- Reduction/returning is not the end but for reproduction to continue conducting the life. Dead is not the end but to be reborn.
			- Produce = intent * extent = multiplication = extension = action(operation) <> Reduce = content/intent = division = contraction = observation
				- Produce: The self (intent, machine) follows the known extent (external knowledge, program) to extend itself by attaching new layers of self (calling subroutines) represented by the extent. The extended self (intent*extent) in its turn becomes the intent of the next steps (intent' = intent*extent), both in production and reduction.
				- Reduce: Reaching the limit of content, the self reduces that content to 2 reducts: result (extent, main effect) and remainder (exception, side effect).
				- Reduct handling: In computer procedure, the result is returned and the remainder is thrown as exception. In maths, the remainder is integrated into the result as "real number". In D*, the remainder is used as a new intent to refined the self via interunion.
				  ==> Effect handling methods differ in how to handle exceptions (the "whole" part is very much the same):
				- Computer procedure clear cuts the boundary (returning point) => clean & clear discrete steps in algorithm => constructive, but put all charge of control and exception digestion/refinement to computer's oracle, i.e. human.
				- Maths does refine the extent by the remainder but keeps the intent (base, radix) intact => predicative, not constructive.
				- D* & autonoton **refine the intent** by the remainder => constructive & refinable => the remainder is the bridge, the link between circles so that the whole uninet is connected and the autonoton can pass through the boundaries to go on new life without instruction from above.
				  ==> Refinement = internal production ~ intensional product (of interunion), while execution in algorithms is external production ~ extensional product. The internal production is invisible, hence also called "subduction" and leave "production" to the visible external one.

		- Dimensionality: Perpendicular (orthogonal) = parallel (concurrent) = independent = invisible = unknown (no knowledge) = indivisible (no common divisor, incommensurable)
			- 4 perpendicular arrows in circle: displacement, velocity, acceleration, jerk
			  => perpendicular in space but parallel in time
			  => Time is just the left over perpendicular dimension => remainders, trailing, ghost image
			- Each circle sees the world as itself (1) divided into many (whole) n subthreads in the space, whose content is the timeline (world line) of the self (c=1) divided by n: for k = 1..n: i_k = 1/n

		- Sustainability of whole numbers: All units are similar, like similar figures (○ ~ ◯), having the the same structure and are exactly the same when relaxed.
			- All circles are similar, just different in size (extent). That diff = extent = distance = angle (over right angle)
			- Via projection, the size varies => all circles are just projected images of the same Self Circle.
			- The order of size, the scale ladder of n-th order differentials is the signature of projection.
			- When relaxed, all circles return to 1, all n-th order diff vectors of transcendental functions return to unit vectors => all shapes return to Circle.

		- Abstraction = ignorance = taken for granted = formation
			- abstracted = ignored = formed
		- 3 abstractions in CIE & life:
			- ε-abstraction = abstracting the self intent to a unit ⟪i = 1⟫ = "I'm the standard" = bỏ qua Nhân
				- ε-extension = initiation = activation = putting the self intent into abstract extents to make concrete extensions = init/start the program
			- ω-abstraction = abstracting the extent to a unit ⟪e = 1⟫ = "all circles are equal" = collapsing the process into its initiator/generator = bỏ qua Nghiệp
				- ω-extension = continuation = action = extending the self by the extent = run the program
			- τ-abstraction = abstracting the conditional content to a unit ⟪c = 1⟫ = "you/God/Universe is the absolute" = bỏ qua Duyên
				- τ-extension = interaction = reacting to the external stimulus = let it go (let the program run by its inputs)
		- Abstractions in the most basic op "count" (enum, traverse):
			- τ-abstraction = ignoring the counting subject (content)
			- ε-abstraction = ignoring the unit of counted objects (intent)
			- ω-extension = just count "it" with empty numbers (extent)
			  *) Note that the role of subject/object = content/intent here is invert of the normal interpretation of CIE, due to the relativity of cause-condition, subject-object.

		- Space ~ exp Vs Time ~ line:
			- int(space) = exp(int(time)); ext(time) = exp(ext(space))
			- computation: ExpTime = APSpace (alternating Turing machine)
			- unithread: move forward in time = zooming in on the (current) place, whose extension is space
			  => projectivity: exp increment in time = multiplication in space = climbing the ladder of scales

		- Relativity in sCIfEr: In the ladder of scales, all scales are just relative to the current step/rung (:= 1); without a reference (standard) rung, any rung is just simply 1.
			- Any extension is a multiplication of some standard intent (multiply = copy = replicate = scale up), called its "op intent". An extension without intent just collapses.
			- Any intension (sustent) is a spinning/weaving/wrapping of its extension (= extent times op intent) against some standard intent called "ob intent" = divisor, denominator. Different ob intents see the same extension as different intensions.
			- The scale of a step = (the diff between extensions of op intent & ob intent) / (ob intent) = |obi*obe - opi*ope|/obi. Here, obi = content, opi = intent, ope/obe = extent in CIE. => differential-integral
			  => The 0-extension (obe = 1, ope = 0) of any step has a scale = obi/obi = 1 = full-screen (but empty) image.
				- Further n-extension (ope = n) from the current step c reaching the step c + n with the scale = 1/n = refined scale.
				- The length/extent n of extension = factor of refinement = factor of solidity (the ideal n = ∞ means "absolute solid")

		- CIE in the constructive world of computation: i.e = c
			- The intent i is the subject/self, this/current/index object, the context giving meaning to the extent e which is just an id/symbol
			- The dot operator is the OOP member accessor, i.e, "e of i".
			- The content c is the target object of reference e whose image in the self/source object is the interface i.e.
			- As arrows, i is the inward arrow toward the past, e is the outward arrow toward the future, c is the bundle of spatial arrows.

		- All "effect flows" can be liquefied to "flows of change" and "energy flow": [https://g.co/bard/share/67a202b49d93](https://g.co/bard/share/67a202b49d93)
			- Originally, I used the term "effect" to captures all "stuff" including "side effects" like errors, exceptions, external changes, as well as main effects like controls, data, events, actions, etc.
			- Lately, all stuff from actions to signals are traced to one root: "change", hence "flow of change" is the fundamental nature of all "effect flows".
			- Etymologically, "effect" = ex-facere = external action = the result of action, as in "cause & effect", and has been used for many effects like in Effect System: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_system)
			  —> My "effect" in "effect flow" is just the generalized notion of those effects. The term "effect" indicates its ability to affect anything in touch with it, the property that *the change is always propagating* like a wave.
		- The role of effect flow in (re/trans)formation:
			- Static = "circle" = equilibrated circular effect flow = form; dynamic = "arrow" = unequilibrated effect flow = content
			- The content conform to the form by splitting its circle into 2 arrows, 1 forward arrow is absorbed into the mass of the form, 1 backward arrow is reflected back
				- The forward arrow seems to disappear due to the much bigger mass of crystallized content in the form compared to that little arrow;
				- The absorbed arrows are collected in some "buffer of change" before making apparent changes. Apparent changes appear abruptly when that buffer is full and being reset, hence quantized.
				- The backward arrow is the feedback from the form called "feeddown", and the forward arrow is the feedforward from the content called "feedup".
			- The effect flow system completes the Turing machine by endowing it with buffers of change at every nodes (joints) so that the form can be fluidized when time comes: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluidization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluidization)
				- The "buffer of change" is the remainder (not roundly divided) in Euclidean division.
				- The traditional power-based positional number system and Turing machine have no such buffer, hence rigid.
				- Uninet and continued fraction number system have flexibility thanks to their buffer of change which tolerates minor changes.
				- In uninet, traditional Turing-machine components are like bones in the body which transfer effects much faster and efficiently than soft tissues and fluids. But the bone itself cannot absorb shocks which will be absorbed by the rubbery articular disc (buffer of change).
				- This applet with small dt value shows how the little change "tunnels" inside the form to gradually reform it: [https://www.geogebra.org/m/dhxkubcd](https://www.geogebra.org/m/dhxkubcd)
		- The construction is not the "formation" I usually mean: [https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Q1FZghDl5wjgI1M0xIbQOyZp7Dcyh35C_8veL8sa3iM](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Q1FZghDl5wjgI1M0xIbQOyZp7Dcyh35C_8veL8sa3iM)
			- The narrow meaning of formation = emergence = integration of changes = crystallization of content used in Uniinfo excludes construction, and is always continuously happening throughout time. The past formation is contracted into a process of "designing" and the current formation is the underlying reformation.
			- When that formation is a spiral, the construction is just a radius segment cross-cutting the sprial.
			- Construction = replay of the crosscut of knowledge = feeddown flow of constraints from the "design" = constraint flow
			- Conformation = the turning around constrained by that radius string
			- Reformation = feedup flow of the change from the here-now (interface, stage, current place) which gradually extends the radius.
