		- this [refactoring](((67710747-2982-4134-875e-3b715313db87))) itself is more complicated than i thought!
		- just take a break, breathe, review...
		- i must close i eyes...
		- the ‚Äúmaster plan‚Äù should be split into the spatial ((67760c43-58c6-40eb-b874-40afae448966)), and the temporal ((6651adea-e1ed-4884-93eb-5ebd6086b62b)) list
		- what's the structure of Mind Map?

			- its roots are the problems and questions
		- [!] the right sidebar now is very lagging
		- i've just got a walk outside, wandering around
			- in a silent space, i could zoom out deep into the mind to see meta-info
			- [!] the braindumping texts didn't show the overall image!!
				- for an overview, the most thing can be done with text is to fold them up... that's why i still use folding blocks in Braindumping.
		- any block (task, issue, quesion) should start in context
			- then it will be moved out when it's grown big
		- look into the Problems & Questions in Mind Map, i want to sort and clean them up!
			- luckily, they are not to much!
		- How should the braindumps be flushed?
			- some things should be retained!
			- the old braindumps should be reviewed and restructured before being flushed
		- currently, there are 2 ends about the Mind Map, closing the effect circle
			- forward end: the urge to design it properly
			- backward end: some questions arised and should be placed into the Mind Map itself
				- [?] why is the central Mind Map required?
				- [?] why a strong urge to design it no matter how unclear it is?
		- [?] a recurrent task as a reminder

			- [!] even at this dead end, i still have a strong urge to penetrate it... e.g. with custom property and somehow to convert between HHMMSS and `time-ms` üòï
				- custom property
				  DEADLINE:: <2025-01-04 Sat 10:04>
				- just missing a way to convert this property from/to `time-ms`
				- `/Current time` = 10:32
			- DONE use both: `scheduled::` for warning (yellow), and `deadline::` for error (red)

		  id:: 677cc7d2-02f7-4ad9-801c-3079237ed465
			- at noon, on the way to company, seeing the karma as the momentum accumulated in our bodies pushing us, making us rush... i want to put all them down... but i also know that nothing can completely stop, the motion just curls inward...
			- sitting down the chair, i relax and release my mind, then falling asleep.
			- 2 straight hours sleepy meditation, from 13:00 to 15:00, then half an hour ujjayi breathing
