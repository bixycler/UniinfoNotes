				- While working with the project Pre.Env. for company, i saw a broken symlink not hilited as normal.
				- Then i [searched for `LS_COLORS`](((67ac4f68-8af4-4886-9183-85de0039250c))) but failed due to a trailing space.
				- I thought it was just a very simple task, just "going to be done now!"
				- So, i didn't even bother to track that task!
				- Chatted with Copilot, searched all over the place,... it's turned out to be not so simple at all!
				- LLMs like Copilot and Google Search AI are helpful but have many hallucinations & delutions.

					- Respone to Copilot's hallucination: I've searched myself and see `ca` = `CAPABILITY` not `FILECAP`, `rs` = `RESET` not `NORMAL`, as shown in this [stackexchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/70715/566548)
					- Copilot was obssesed with that GitHub gist so much that you place [that link](https://gist.github.com/thomd/7667642) to the "StackExchange discussion" text! üôÅ
