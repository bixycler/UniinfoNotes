		- this [refactoring](((67710747-2982-4134-875e-3b715313db87))) itself is more complicated than i thought!
		- just take a break, breathe, review...

				- its roots are the problems and questions
			- [!] the right sidebar now is very lagging
			- i've just got a walk outside, wandering around
				- in a silent space, i could zoom out deep into the mind to see meta-info
				- [!] the braindumping texts didn't show the overall image!!
					- for an overview, the most thing can be done with text is to fold them up... that's why i still use folding blocks in Braindumping.
			- any block (task, issue, quesion) should start in context
				- then it will be moved out when it's grown big
			- look into the Problems & Questions in Mind Map, i want to sort and clean them up!
				- luckily, they are not to much!
			- How should the braindumps be flushed?
				- some things should be retained!
				- the old braindumps should be reviewed and restructured before being flushed
			- currently, there are 2 ends about the Mind Map, closing the effect circle
				- forward end: the urge to design it properly
				- backward end: some questions arised and should be placed into the Mind Map itself
					- [?] why is the central Mind Map required?
					- [?] why a strong urge to design it no matter how unclear it is?
		- [?] a recurrent task as a reminder
