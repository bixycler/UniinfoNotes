		- [!] My expression of "arrogance"
		  collapsed:: true
			- Even i've never thought that i'm better/higher than anyone else, my expression does show some trace of arrogance which has been fed back by my (close) friends. Is shows something is hidden deep inside my unconsciousness. Here i list some causes that i can reflect on this problem.
			- 1st, the **illusion of** ((66537674-6cf9-4459-8bea-7c1858c694a3))
			  id:: 669a58b9-422a-40d9-adcf-b2aade86c170
			  The (holistic) view from above shows me the way and makes me feel that "i've known the way already, it's just a piece of cake" and forget that it's just a "map" and the actual walking the way is much much harder with much more efforts.
				- I've called it by many names: the karma of theorist (theorist karma), the sickness of talent (talent sickness).
				- My karma of theorist also corrodes others' trust on me.
				  id:: 668f4faf-db30-497a-a271-b2bbf5264413
				- My karma of theorist is deep.... [inside my trousers 😄](https://www.facebook.com/lexuandinhct/posts/pfbid02kppLiTrw7mWPdp3V8bVLq6MvQDb3FNBaseh1znLspueCQrcC1esTKbsT4PCB8663l)
				  collapsed:: true
					- ![KarmaOfTheorist.jpg](../assets/Will/KarmaOfTheorist.jpg)
				- This illusion contributes greatly to ((669a58b9-1a52-4ad7-932a-9e45ecb9960e)).
			- 2nd, the **implosive attitude** of my inner self toward external forms as if i'm fighting for the abolition of these forms ("đả phá"). Even though i consider "all views are equal"... they are just "equal in theory" while in practice i have a hidden tendency to consider my "inner view through content" superior to the "external view through form" of others.
		- [!] The clash between internal work and external work
		  id:: 6677b986-ada2-4c73-8a11-980cdf9cb6d4
		  collapsed:: true
			- As i dive deep inside, it's hard to surface up to do external works, hence many delays in (official) works.
				- I'm hooked to the deep works in front of my eyes. This hook is the tool that helps me to concentrate and avoid distraction from surrounding environment.

				  CLOCK: [2024-07-22 Mon 09:34:43]
				  :END:
					- Without distraction, it's easier for me to stay in the free & mindful state. But in the free state, it's also difficult for me to interact with external tools like note taking, speaking, writing, forming formula, etc.
					- This hook can be replaced with the [ujjayi breath](((66952126-bf33-40e1-a208-369df7aa9488))). Using the internal tool (breath) gives me more control than the external tool (external sink).
			- When i interrupt the internal work, my self is fragmented, heavy, lack motivation to do anything.
			- DOING **Duck dive** is a serious problem!
			  :LOGBOOK:
			  CLOCK: [2024-12-29 Sun 20:02:37]

				- I usually dive head-first, _without planning_, into the works and issues, which usually **branch off** into lots of new works and issues
			- **Perfectionism**
			  id:: 6678d594-9819-4624-abd6-d4ec62b3874f
			  collapsed:: true
			  The requirement that my self must be smooth, full, round, coherent, unfragmented is the sign of perfectionism.
				- First, let's [refine](((669a5162-19e1-4c52-8888-ab7cbfe275ec))) the large circle into smaller circles, thus they are still round & perfect circles but can be interleaved with other works.
				  id:: 6677bc01-44ec-4e4a-aeed-d63996bc0c46
				- The illusion of "finish soon"
				  id:: 669a58b9-1a52-4ad7-932a-9e45ecb9960e
				  collapsed:: true
					- ((6651ecba-793d-43c5-8020-a9f260b032d8)) When we feel something is finishing soon, we concentrate more on it, put all of our effort to it to get it finished... until we're out of resource and recognize that it's still far from the finish line.
					- Like the first experience of ["this is not the true peak"](https://www.facebook.com/lexuandinhct/posts/pfbid02eArjSbGz7GhpU2aFwh2qia53BcuwhstSE263jXVvf9tamUbL2K2JCF2LD97RQQ4ql) when i climbed mount Núi Lớn, Vũng Tàu, when i was a child, until now, that illusion is still haunting me.
					- In gambling/game psychology, it's called "[near-miss effect](https://www.psychologyofgames.com/2016/09/the-near-miss-effect-and-game-rewards/)".

					- This [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) is just a kind of distortion in perspective view (projective/inversive geometry): 1/∞ = 0.
					  collapsed:: true
						- Our view is always distorted so that the far end always look shorter. So, when the goal is clearly visible to us, we can't help seeing the distance to it is short even if it's at infinity, just like the Moon looks very close to us at the horizon like "just some arms away".
					- The opposite of near-miss effect is the goal-fog effect where we lose motivation to reach a very near goal due to the obscurity of that goal.
					- It stems from ((669a58b9-422a-40d9-adcf-b2aade86c170))
						- The seemingly small and easy targets, which are just ((66537674-6cf9-4459-8bea-7c1858c694a3))s, draw me into the rabbit holes.

					- “Complete, finished, done, target reached, ...” are just illusions. Nothing is actually complete, any ((667d15c6-67c4-4998-a549-c8b3f9de3d60)) is just a helix or spiral which is projected onto the plane orthogonal to the direction of change/evolution.
					- Most of us are goal/target reaching machines with a built-in motivation to complete the circle.
						- The inner target of the ((667bef22-b272-4a7d-b613-3f1ed1a47329)) is the driver, operator, controller of the whole ((667c0031-0a87-44c9-9e98-6d45893b095f)).
						- The target is the hidden boss, the inner ((667c015e-6223-4f8a-ae84-a93a49f4ff94)), the underlying driving force.
						- **Revealing the hidden boss** means **detaching the self**.
							- “Detached self = selfless”
							- When a boss is brought out to the light, in front of everyone, to be examined like any one else, it loses its (absolute) privilege, and its influence is restored to the right place with the right amount. Its influence is still high thanks to its central position, but no more privilege, and the “boss” is now simply an individual equal to all other individuals in right.
							- It's different from shunting, suppressing the boss to eliminate its influence via rebellion, which is usually the counter effect of the long time overpowering by the boss.
					- The basic illustion is that “when the circle is completed, it ends, finishes, no more worry”, while actually it's just _the **beginning** of a new circle_, either at the same level or at “higher” level.
					- While the true ending, the true finish is the death, either bodily or mentally, we always try to reach the end of some “hard work” wishing to have an easier living, either on Earth or on Heaven, or at Nibbana (Nirvana). That's the basic illusion of both life & death.
						- The urge to finish is a manifestation of _the urge to die_ in the guise of life, either as an orgasm or an explosion.
							- While Freud described [death drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_drive) (Thanatos) as the opposite of sex drive (Eros), i see they are just two faces of the same coin with the same nature.
						- Due to the guise of life, we fall into the contradiction of continuously reaching (small) deaths in the hope of avoiding (big) death.
						- Accepting death is no problem to me and i've spent my whole life to explore various types of death.

							  collapsed:: true
								- Let's go, don't get too engrossed in this place.
								- But haven’t we already reached our destination?! After all the time, effort, sweat, and even blood we've spent to get here, shouldn’t we enjoy the fruits of our labor instead of moving on, master?!
								- I've allowed you to enjoy it for a whole week. If you think it's not enough, you can stay and enjoy it. I'll go alone.
								- It's not about enjoyment. I followed you to reach liberation, not to seek pleasure. If I wanted to enjoy myself, I would have stayed in the city with all its pleasures instead of tiring myself out climbing the mountain with you.
								- If you still want liberation, follow me.
								- But why do we need to move on when we've reached the destination of liberation?
								- This is not the destination.
								- Clearly, back in the city, when I asked, “Where do we go to find freedom?” you pointed to this mountain.
								- At that time, the city’s buildings blocked the view, so I had to point to a tall mountain for you to see. But I meant that “the destination lies at the horizon.”
								- So we can never reach the destination 😮‍💨?!
								- We can.
								- Have you reached the destination, master?
								- I have.
								- You're lying! Back in the city, I never saw the horizon, so you could fool me. But now, after months of travel, I've seen for myself: The horizon is endless. The more we walk towards it, the further it moves away, so we can never truly touch it.
								- I didn't deceive you. I only spoke in a way you could see and understand. Before, I didn’t say “the destination is the horizon” because you hadn't yet seen and understood what the horizon is. Today, I'm not deceiving you, either. I only speak according to what you now see. Now, look straight ahead; do you see the horizon?
								- I see the horizon as a straight line in front of me, but it’s just an illusion; there’s no actual line!
								- I only asked if you see it or not!
								- Yes, I see it.
								- Now, look behind; do you see the horizon?
								- Yes, I do.
								- Look to both the left and right; do you see the horizon?
								- Enough! On this mountaintop 🗻, wherever I look, I see the horizon. Don’t ask such redundant questions!!!
								- If you've seen it, let's go!
								- Why move on if we'll never reach it?!!!
								- I've reached it, that's why I'm leading you. If you don't want to go, you can stay here.
								- Wait, master, you can't leave! You owe me an explanation of how you can reach that endless horizon!
								- I've reached it by bringing the horizon right beneath my feet.
								- 😮 How is that possible...
								- I told you before that you wouldn't understand! It's only because you pushed me that I had to say it.

									- Ủa, chẳng phải chúng ta đã tới đích rồi sao?! Đi bao nhiêu lâu, mất bao sức lực, mồ hồi và cả máu mới tới được đích... không hưởng thành quả mà còn đi đâu nữa thầy?!
									- Ta đã cho con hưởng thụ cả tuần qua rồi đó thôi, nếu con thấy chưa đủ thì cứ ở lại hưởng thụ đi, thầy đi một mình.
									- Vấn đề không phải là hưởng thụ, con theo thầy là để tới chỗ giải thoát chứ không phải để hưởng thụ. Nếu thích hưởng thụ thì còn đã ở lại trong đời rồi, có bao nhiêu thú vui ở đó chứ theo thầy lên núi chi cho mệt vậy?!
									- Nếu còn muốn giải thoát thì theo ta đi tiếp.
									- Nhưng tại sao phải đi tiếp khi chúng ta đã tới được đích giải thoát?
									- Đây không phải là đích.
									- Rõ ràng hồi ở trong thành phố, khi con hỏi “đi đâu để tìm được tự do” thì thầy đã chỉ tay về phía ngọn núi này mà.
									- Lúc đó trong thành phố bị nhà cửa che khuất tầm mắt nên ta phải chỉ ngọn núi cao để cho con thấy thôi, chứ thực ra ý ta muốn nói rằng “cái đích nằm ở chân trời”.
									- Vậy là không bao giờ tới được đích sao 😮‍💨?!
									- Tới được.
									- Vậy thầy đã tới đích chưa?
									- Ta tới rồi.
									- Thầy nói dối! Ngày xưa trong thành phố con chưa thấy chân trời bao giờ thì thầy còn có thể lừa con được, chứ mấy tháng nay đi ra ngoài thì con đã chứng thực rồi: Chân trời là vô tận, mình càng đi tới bao nhiêu thì nó càng lùi về xa bấy nhiêu, nên không thể nào chạm được tới chân trời đâu.
									- Ta không lừa con, ta chỉ nói theo những gì con có thể thấy và hiểu được. Ngày trước ta không nói “đích là chân trời” vì lúc đó con chưa thấy và hiểu rõ chân trời là gì. Hôm nay ta cũng không lừa con, ta chỉ nói theo những gì con đang thấy mà thôi. Này, nhìn thẳng về trước, con có thấy chân trời không?
									- Con thấy chân trời như một đường thẳng trước mặt, nhưng đó chỉ là ảo giác, thực ra không có đường đó!
									- Ta chỉ hỏi có thấy hay không?!
									- Dạ có thấy.
									- Giờ quay về phía sau, con có thấy chân trời không?
									- Dạ thấy.
									- Con nhìn cả trái lẫn phải đi xem có thấy chân trời không?
									- Thôi khỏi! Trên đỉnh núi 🗻 này thì dòm đâu chẳng thấy chân trời, thầy đừng hỏi những câu thừa thải như vậy nữa!!!
									- Thấy rồi thì đi thôi!
									- Đi chẳng bao giờ tới thì đi làm gì cơ chứ?!!!
									- Ta đã tới rồi nên mới dẫn con đi. Con không muốn đi thì cứ ở lại đây.
									- Khoan, thầy không được đi! Thầy còn nợ con lời giải thích làm sao thầy có thể tới được cái chân trời vô tận đó!
									- Ta tới được bằng cách kéo chân trời về ngay dưới chân ta.
									- 😮 Làm sao có thể được...
									- Ta đã bảo là điều này con chưa thể hiểu được mà! Tại con ép thì ta mới phải nói thôi.

							- Let's shift from the ~~**goal-oriented**~~ and target-driven way of life to the **present-oriented** and whole-driven (holistic) way.

								- As long as we're walking, we're "on the horizon"; anytime one thinks "i've reached the target", that one is deluding itself and effectively withdraw itself away from the horizon.
								- It's the difference between cyclic nature and linear nature, between the circle and the arrow.
								- The ultimate goal is (the center of) the totality, the whole, while all targets are intermediate points on the (endless) way to the goal.
						- Training the non-attached looking
							- First, detach, keep distance until the mind returns to neutral attitude.
							- Next, slowly approach the object while being aware of all mental reactions.
							- Observe the reactions and connect them with the whole, reminding the whole with all aspects, all sides, all conflicting parts.
							- Frequently back off for the holistic relations to emerge.
							- Remember to breathe!
							- In the training, all actions should be done automatically without any intention.
							- Training sessions should run alternately with actual working sessions.
