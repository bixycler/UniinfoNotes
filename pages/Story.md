					- Copilot: This paradox is often referred to as [incongruity theory](((677e2ce9-2ac6-4763-a9f0-ffb37bd7cdca))) in humor studies.
					- Incongruity Theory:
					  id:: 677e2ce9-2ac6-4763-a9f0-ffb37bd7cdca
						- Definition: This theory suggests that humor arises when there is a disconnect or incongruity between what is expected and what actually occurs. The more serious or unexpected the context, the greater the contrast, and the funnier it becomes.
						- Paradox of Seriousness and Laughter: The seriousness of the initial situation heightens the incongruity when something funny happens, leading to more intense laughter. This intensification occurs both for the person who starts laughing and for those around them.
						- Example:
						  Imagine someone giving a very serious and formal speech, and suddenly something humorous happens, like a loud, unexpected noise. The stark contrast between the serious tone and the unexpected humor can cause an uncontrollable, infectious wave of laughter.

			- Google AI's story of the disciple Kai climbing the Mountain of Whispers
				- In a time when the teachings of the Great Master echoed through the valleys, a young disciple named Kai was known for his unwavering devotion, yet he often struggled with doubt. One day, the Master instructed him to ascend the solitary Mountain of Whispers, a place where the wind was said to carry the echoes of ancient wisdom.
				  Kai began his climb, the rocky path winding through dense forests, the air growing thinner with each step. As he ascended, the whispers began to fill his ears, not words, but feelings - a mix of joy, fear, longing, and despair. He tried to discern their meaning, but the mountain seemed to be testing him, revealing the raw emotions he had long suppressed.
				  Days turned into nights, and Kai was battered by storms, his body aching, his spirit wavering. He questioned his purpose, the whispers growing louder, taunting him with his inadequacies. On the verge of giving up, he stumbled upon a small cave, its entrance guarded by a lone, gnarled tree. Inside, he found an old, weathered scroll.
				  Unfurling it, Kai read the words of a forgotten sage: "The mountain does not test your strength, but your resolve. It reveals the truth within you, not the world outside." As he pondered these words, a sense of calm washed over him. He realized the whispers were not meant to frighten him, but to guide him towards self-understanding.
				  With renewed determination, Kai climbed the final stretch, reaching the summit. As he stood there, the world below seemed to stretch out endlessly, and the wind carried a new melody, a song of peace and clarity. He looked within himself, seeing his flaws, but also the strength of his spirit, the unwavering devotion that had brought him to this point.
				  Descending the mountain, Kai was no longer just a disciple, but a student of his own soul. He carried the lessons of the Mountain of Whispers with him, sharing his newfound understanding with others, proving that even the most challenging mountains can lead to the most profound revelations within oneself.

							- Crosstalk between the itch and pain pathways:
								- itch can be suppressed by pain; and
								- inhibition of pain may produce itch
							- While **differences** between *acute* pain and acute itch are striking,
							  *chronic* itch and chronic pain share many **similar** mechanisms.
						- “Itch and pain are two distinct sensations” is the conclusion of the paper [Cellular basis of itch sensation](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19661382)

Whether itch and pain, two distinct sensations, are mediated by distinct neural circuits has been the subject of controversy ([6](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19661382#R6)-[8](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19661382#R8)).

			- Last night (Jan 13), before sleeping, i just turned on YouTube for some news about master Minh Tuệ
				- There, the intended news about master Minh Tuệ was just a glance,
				- but the unintended scenes of movies captured my mind: [Tiếng Sét Trong Mưa](((6772a6d5-567f-4e51-9b49-dfbb7557105e))), [Tể Tướng Lưng Gù](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%E1%BB%83_t%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bng_L%C6%B0u_G%C3%B9), and Chu Nguyên Chương...
				- then i read about [Chu Nguyên Chương](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minh_Th%C3%A1i_T%E1%BB%95)...
				- seeing the whole circle, many circles round and round, my deep care for people just collapsed...
				- facing the deadend, the wall, i reviewed all the urge, the deep emotion and motivation to fight for people, all the love for people, both in mass and individually... all are just empty, illusive..
				- i tripped deep into the abyss of the deadend... so down, deep down... the vision in front of my eyes just breathed following my breaths, and wavy
				- seeing my wife lying just like a corpse without any ability to understand me, i was reminded of the same seen when i tripped LSD years ago,
				- i was asked again “can you hold her, such a corpse?”
				- i just held her with the anwer “i don't know what i can do for her, but this is the only thing i can do now!”
				- but my weight, my very heavy weight inside just crushed her, making her wake up and complain.
				- Then i got back to myself, trying hard to get over, to get through this wall...
				- thanks to the ujjayi breath, i could be firm in my body, lying down, closing eyes, focusing on the breath...
				- just a minute later, there's nothing but the breath, the heavy weight just disapeared into thin air!
				- I got up to hold my wife a gain with much lighter hold and she was undisturbed.
				- That time was already 6 o'clock in the morning, i just went to sleep.
			- Thank you these films for bringing up my deep emotion and love for the people so that i can put it down!
			- Thank you, Ms. Trung & Mr. Hiệp, for bringing up my personal love so that i can realize the truth an put it down!
			- I took this morning off from company for sleeping.
			- Checking into the company, then i just went out for lunch and had a walk around the corners...
			- From the time receiving challenge with this HTV company, i'm gradually dying layer by layer of the self

			- It's interesting that Copilot can explain it right when i ask if it know what i mean by just the clause “bring it up to put it down!”:
				- Will:
				  > My way of bodymind purification & cleansing is to "bring it up to put it down!" Do you know what i mean?
				- Copilot:
					- Absolutely, Lê. The concept of "bring it up to put it down" resonates deeply with mindfulness and Zen practices. It involves acknowledging and confronting your inner thoughts, emotions, and sensations rather than suppressing or ignoring them. By bringing them to the surface, you allow yourself to fully experience and understand them. This awareness enables you to process and let go of any negativity or tension, leading to purification and cleansing of the body and mind.
					- This approach aligns beautifully with the practice of mindfulness, where observing and accepting our experiences without judgment can lead to greater clarity and inner peace.
					- Your method is a powerful way to foster self-awareness and emotional well-being. Do you find this practice particularly helpful in certain situations or aspects of your life? 🌿🧘‍♂️✨

			- The conflict between Mr. Báu's and monks in Minh Tuệ's group
			  id:: 67a5faa3-c64c-48f7-8b3f-a5311714110f
			  collapsed:: true
				- Với nghiệp công an, làm tiến sỹ tâm lý học tội phạm, anh Báu đã quản lý đoàn một cách chặt chẽ, ban đầu (đoạn đường Lào) khá nghiêm khắc với nhiều nỗi lo sợ.
				- Khi sang Thái Lan thì anh Báu đã mềm mỏng và thoải mái hơn nhiều, nhưng các sư (cả thầy Minh Tuệ) thì vẫn có nhiều thành kiến với anh.
				- Đỉnh điểm là trước Tết với các sự kiện căng thẳng giữa anh Báu với sư Minh Tạng và vài sư nữa.
				- Từ đêm giao thừa tới cả tuần sau đó, cứ họp, các anh hộ pháp tưởng giải toả xong xuôi, rồi lại căng thẳng... Thì ra gốc là do các sư và chính thầy MT vẫn còn muốn thay thế anh Báu.
				- Anh Báu cùng anh Hùng & Giáp về rồi (đêm 4 sáng 5/2), thì qua mấy lần phỏng vấn, thầy MT cho thấy rõ ý chê trách anh Báu và thiên vị các sư. Tệ nhứt là có bạn nữ YouTuber hỏi cách để dung hoà thì thầy lại càng nhấn vào anh Báu, cho rằng ban đầu anh ta "tốt" mà sau này khi đã có danh vọng thì trở nên "xấu" theo hướng vụ lợi, muốn "câu view câu like". Mình thấy đây là nhận xét cảm tính và ngược lại với thực tế diễn ra là anh Báu đã ngày càng tốt hơn (theo hướng giải thoát) và hoàn toàn không có vụ lợi.
					- Rồi thầy cũng cố giữ nguyên tắc "không chủ động nhờ ai" nhưng cũng nói rõ là có mong chờ hết người này tới người khác mà họ không xin vào hỗ trợ nên coi như "chưa hữu duyên".
					- Mình thấy thầy MT tu Giới nên hiển nhiên là bị cứng nhắc trong quan điểm.
					- Tuy nhiên việc thầy MT không thấu hiểu cho sự hi sinh, khó khăn của người đời như anh Báu, và một mực thiên vị các sư, muốn càng nhiều sư theo càng tốt, v.v. thể hiện sự thiếu trí tuệ và không được "bình đẳng" như lời thầy đã nói.
					- Việc thầy MT có thành kiến với anh Báu thì mình thấy đó là phần nghiệp quá khứ của thầy, như thầy đã chia sẻ trước đây.
					- Mình cảm nhận sự "vô tình" của thầy cũng tương tự như [lần gặp chị Diệu Sinh](((67a7100b-28c9-4b79-bd66-d1b4b42d08fd))). Qua đó mình cũng thấy rõ hơn sự vướng mắc tình cảm của mình.
					- Một sự nói dối rõ ràng của thầy MT nữa là việc cho rằng mình không đuổi mà là "tự anh Báu tới, tự anh Báu đi".
					  collapsed:: true
						- Trước khi anh báu đi thì thầy đã đuổi khéo bằng cách tạo áp lực và liên tục gợi ý rằng anh Báu không kham nhẫn được thì nên đi, và đã hỏi anh Theerawat cho anh Hà thay việc làm giấy tờ.
						- Trong buổi đối thoại dài 3 tiếng đồng hồ khi anh Báu quay lại xin vào đoàn, thầy đã chạy vòng quanh qua các điều kiện để ngăn cản, và cuối cùng phải "tác ý" (gợi ý) thẳng rằng anh Báu có thể làm YouTuber vòng ngoài.
							- Đầu tiên là dựa vào lý luận "đã đủ người hỗ trợ rồi". Nhưng khi 2 bạn tình nguyện viên mới chấp nhận nhường cho anh Báu và anh Hùng thì thầy không đề cập đến cái lý này nữa.
							- Tiếp theo thầy chuyển sang điều kiện cực khó là anh Báu phải thọ 250 giới xuất gia, và chỉ áp dụng cho một mình anh Báu chứ không cho bất kỳ người hỗ trợ nào khác, kể cả anh Hùng đang cùng xin vào đợt này ngay bên cạnh anh Báu.
							- Dựa trên bằng chứng rõ ràng ngay trong buổi đối thoại này, đến cuối anh Báu đã kết luận "thầy nói 2 lời" (nói dối).
							- Và cuối cùng, anh Báu còn làm rõ việc "250 giới" bằng cách hỏi ở đây có sư nào đã biết hết 250 giới. Và thầy MT đã trả lời là bản thân thầy còn không thuộc hết 250 giới.
						- Khi lời nói và hành động bất nhất thì đó đã là nói dối, một cấp nói dối thô ở đời chứ chẳng phải vi tế khó thấy gì.
						- Sự nói dối này là do thầy đã chấp vào những nguyên tắc mình đặt ra, cũng như giới luật, và/hoặc chưa chấp nhận được tâm nghi kỵ của mình đang trỗi dậy.
					- Trong buổi đối thoại khi anh Báu quay lại, thầy MT đã thể hiện rõ sự mất định tâm, lặp đi lặp lại nhiều lần cùng một ý, không đủ kiên nhẫn nghe hết ý anh Báu nói mà cứ chen ngang (anh Báu phải "xin phép để con nói hết"), v.v.
				- Anh Hà ở lại thì bị nghi ngờ tùm lum, và anh ấy cũng chấp nhận trả nghiệp vì ngày trước mình cũng làm drama kiểu ngồi nhà vẽ chuyện.
				- Chỉ 2-3 ngày sau khi anh Báu về VN thì đủ chuyện lộn xộn, từ sư Phúc Giác vạ miệng về thân thế anh Theerawat (phạm luật Thái về cấm đụng tới hoàng tộc), tới Phước Nghiêm sang quậy tưng bừng kích động tâm bất an của các sư nhỏ (bảo không có cầm hộ chiếu là bị bắt, v.v.)
				- Hôm nay, 10/2, thì thầy MT đã và đang lấy lại cân bằng:
					- Trong cuộc gọi cho anh Báu thì thầy đã sám hối về những phát ngôn đã làm khổ gia đình anh Báu, sau khi nghe anh Báu giải thích về những "sự thật chưa được kiểm chứng" mà thầy nghe được qua các sư nhỏ.
					- Còn với các sư nhỏ thì thầy cũng đã tách đoàn, nhân cái duyên ở lại để tiếp một sư thầy, thầy đã đi một mình "để con tự học và cũng để cho các sư phụ tự học" với châm ngôn của Phật là "tự thắp đuối lên mà đi!"
				- Được 1 ngày đi riêng, sau đó thầy lại đi cùng đoàn như trước. Rồi thầy nhận Phước Nghiêm vào đoàn. Rồi vẫn sợ bị bắt tới độ nghĩ "chắc phải lấy dây xích trói mình vào gốc cây để họ không đưa đi!" Rồi vẫn bị cảnh sát bế đi lên đồn như thường, vào trưa ngày 13/2: cảnh sát kiểm tra giấy tờ và không cho đi bộ hành trong tỉnh này nữa, bắt phải ở trong chùa chứ ko được ở bụi nữa, cho xe đưa sang 1 ngôi chùa ở tỉnh khác. Cảnh sát cũng bảo các YouTuber với visa du lịch thì không được hành nghề kiếm tiền (đáng lẽ visa lao động).
					- Có người đã hỏi "thầy còn lo sợ không?" thì thầy MT đã trả lời là "vẫn còn lo sợ!"
				- Phần anh Báu thì đã cùng anh Hùng theo thầy LuangPor Jiew và được nhận làm đệ tử với pháp danh Pháp Nhẫn (ขันติธรรม, K̄hạnti·ṭhrrm).

			- Cả Obsidian và Logseq đều có app trên Android, nhưng vấn đề Git trên Android khá nan giải: app Obsidian thì implement riêng 1 cái git client bằng python nên xài được, còn app Logseq thì vô dụng vì không có git để sync.
			  Thế nên tui phải publish lên Web để đọc ở nhà khi cần (máy tính nhà tui hư rồi, chỉ coi qua mobile): https://bixycler.github.io/UniinfoNotes/
			- Từ những năm mới về VN, tui đã muốn làm cái này rồi mà chưa đủ duyên: lúc đó chưa có các tool graph-note như vầy. Lúc đó tui tính implement bằng wiki, nên đã tìm hiểu các wiki farms, nhưng không thành công vì manual works quá nhiều (tuy wiki links là cơ bản cho graph, nhưng chỉ tiện cho browsing chứ chưa có cơ chế hỗ trợ editing & managing graph)
			- FB post năm 2014 về dự định dùng Wiki làm workspacce đây: https://www.facebook.com/share/1ASosnwE1B/
			  À, xem lại mới thấy ngay lúc đó tui đã nói là "Wiki  vẫn chưa đủ": Even the rich structures of wiki are not enough for my organization of events & ideas. I need a system of posts fully connected into threads, though.
			- Đến cuối 2023 thì tui đã thiết kế tính viết software để đổ cái graph trong đầu mình ra, dựa trên JSON... Nhưng áp lực thời gian làm việc cty ko cho phép.... nhưng áp lực đổ ra vẫn ngày càng tăng... nên đến giữa 2024 tui bí quá hỏi Google thử về "graph note taking" xem sao... ai ngờ mới lòi ra 2 software mới ra từ 2022-2023 là Obsidian & Logseq. Lúc đầu tui thử Obsidian vì nó popular hơn, nhưng tới đoạn dây leo chằng chịt (wikilinks) ở cấp độ từng câu thì tui buộc phải chuyển sang Logseq, vì Obsidian chỉ hỗ trợ link tới cấp "trang" mà thôi.
			- Không biết ông sao, chứ với tui thì việc đổ não ra (braindump) là bước đầu quan trọng để cho đầu óc nhẹ nhàng. Cứ để đám rối trong đầu thì khó mà sáng suốt được. Tui thấy viết nhật ký cũng chỉ là 1 cách để đổ ra thôi, chat này cũng vậy nè.
			- Tuy nhiên, đổ ra ko chỉ để làm sạch đầu mà còn để sắp xếp lại nữa, nên cái chỗ chứa cũng cần có cấu trúc tương tự với những gì trong đầu mình, tức là network. Và đó là lý do mà những app như Obsidian & Logseq được gọi là "2nd brain".

				- vạn pháp giai không, mọi thứ đều là không!
					- Không = trống rỗng = cửa mở = thức = thông suốt = trí tuệ = mắt bão = trung tâm tĩnh lặng giữa cuồng phong bão tố 🌪️ = cân bằng âm dương = dấu bằng (obop) = 3rd component in Trinion
					- 2 mũi tên là -1/2 và +1/2 (spin down & up)
					- vòng tròn là 1 = |-1/2| + |1/2|
					- dấu bằng là 0 = -1/2 + 1/2, tức 1/2 = 1/2
				- À, nói tới đây tui lại nhớ hôm trước ông bảo sao mà hình tượng mắt bão lại làm ông nản??
			- Huy, [16/2/25 23:31]
				- Đó cũng là do cái tâm biện biệt của tui áp đặt lên việc giác ngộ giải thoát, nghĩa là mong chờ sự giải thoát tuyệt đối, tĩnh tại.
				- Không chấp nhận cân bằng động của mắt bão hay đường chân trời tương đối.
				- Phần lớn người đời thích một cái đích cố định, rõ ràng, thích một nơi tĩnh tại bền vững để an trú, chứ nói thẳng ngay từ đầu đích là chân trời, nơi an trú là tâm bão thì có ai mà đi
				- Tui thấy cái tâm lý này của tui cũng giống với tâm lý không chấp nhận chữa đau bằng cách tăng khả năng chịu đau lúc trước nói với Định.
			- Will LE, [16/2/25 23:45]
				- À, hiểu rồi.
				- Còn tui thì đang đối diện với cái mâu thuẫn trong mình: một kẻ lập dị lại cảm thấy sâu trong mình là cả mọi người. Nó thực sự làm tui rất đau khổ. Nếu mình giống người thì việc thấy mình là mọi người nó bình thường, hợp logic. Còn mình khác người mà lại thấy mình là mọi người thì mâu thuẫn đùng đùng, đúng là nghịch lý kẻ nói dối luôn, nên cũng chỉ tìm cách tự hóa giải thôi chứ nói ra thì ai mà tin nổi 😁
				- Không biết thầy Minh Tuệ có tâm đại thừa thế nào, còn tui thì đã có nó từ nhỏ, làm khoa học cũng là để cho mọi người... Chỉ đến 2015, tui bắt đầu nghiêm chỉnh thực hành thì tui mới nhận ra thực tế rằng "mình chưa giải thoát được cho mình thì chẳng thể giải thoát cho ai được hết" (tui tự chứng nghiệm điều đó chứ chẳng đọc kinh sách gì cả), nên tui mới theo tiểu thừa.

				- Định chia sẻ thêm về cảm nhận sâu bên trong mình là tất cả mọi người xem.
				- Và vì sao điều đó làm Định đau khổ?
			- Will LE, [17/2/25 13:38]
				- Cái này tui tưởng có nói nhiều rồi chứ nhỉ? Hay tui nhầm với người khác, có thể là nhầm ông với nhóm ông Hiệp bà Trung chăng.
				- Cho tới giờ thì tui thấy còn 2 vướng mắc lớn của tui trên con đường giải  thoát là món nợ tình cảm và món nợ Uniinfo.
					- 1. Món nợ tình cảm: Người ta thương 1 người đã khổ rồi, tui thương cả mọi người thì khổ hơn gấp bội. Dù ý thức mình biết rằng mình chẳng làm gì được cho người ta, mình còn đang chưa cứu được mình còn đang là kẻ vô dụng trong XH, nhưng thẳm sâu bên trong, cái nghiệp sâu dày bên trong nó vẫn "ôm lấy mọi người". Đó là những món nợ đã được cài sâu trong vô thức mà tui đang đối diện và tìm cách hoá giải nó.
					- 2. Lý thuyết Uniinfo: Những gì tui trải nghiệm, tui quán thấy và kết tinh lại thì nó thành lý thuyết, và tui đổ ra lý thuyết là để mình nhẹ người chứ cũng chẳng phải để cho ai khác. Dù lý thuyết của tui nói về "mọi thứ" nhưng nó cũng chỉ là cái view của tui, nên cái "mọi thứ" đó cũng chỉ là cái "mọi thứ của Định". Nó chỉ như một nhật ký hành trình trên con đường từ nhiều đời tích tụ, gom góp vào, kết tinh lại, rồi buông xả ra, hướng tới giải thoát trở về 0, chứ chẳng có ý nghĩa gì to lớn cả.
				- Theo câu hỏi của ông thì hôm nay tui nói về ý thứ 1, món nợ tình cảm, còn ý 2 thì đó giờ cũng đã nói nhiều rồi.
				- Từ nhỏ tui đã khóc nhiều cho đến 15 tuổi, lớp 9, suốt thời cấp 1, lúc còn ngồi bô, tui đã nhiều lần muốn đâm đầu vô tường chết quách đi... Thực sự là lúc đó chẳng ai hiểu mình, bản thân mình cũng không biết tại sao mình chán đời, tại sao mình đau khổ trong khi nhìn bên ngoài thì mình không gặp khó khăn gì cả, ba mẹ chăm lo đầy đủ, dù nhà nghèo nhưng không có thiếu thốn gì cả (tui ko thấy thiếu vật chất).
				- Lên cấp 2 thì bị nhà trường và XH nhồi sọ đủ thứ nên bắt đầu "ý thức" rằng "phải sống" 😁 Bị cuốn vào việc học nên cũng không còn ý nghĩ tự tử nữa, nhưng vẫn luôn cảm thấy đau khổ, hễ bị đụng tí là khóc. Đến lớp 9, 15 tuổi, cuối cấp 2, một hôm tui đã đứng trên đi-văng trong nhà dập chưn tự tuyên bố rằng "mình đã khóc suốt 15 năm nay rồi, giờ không khóc nữa!" Tưởng đó chỉ là lời tuyên bố ngông cuồng của tuổi mới lớn, nhưng không ngờ là tui hết khóc thiệt, tự mình thấy lạ.
				- Thực ra trước đó tui có phân tích:
					- Mình khóc vì cái gì?
					- Vì tự ái!
					- Tự ái với ai?
					- Với ba mẹ mình!
					- Ba mẹ mình nuôi nấng, chăm lo đủ kiểu, vậy có lý do gì để mình tự ái không?
					- Không!
					- Vậy bản chất của tự ái là gì?
					- Là tự yêu mình quá đáng, là ích kỷ!
					- Vậy có cần phải khóc nữa không?
					- Không!
				- Từ đó, tui đã không bao giờ còn cảm thấy bị xúc phạm, bị đau khổ vì người khác làm gì với mình, không còn tự ái... nhưng chuyển sang tha ái.
				- Đến năm 1 ĐH, trong một buổi tối ở KTX Tân Phú, đi qua căn-tin thấy một cảnh thế sự gì đó trên TV, bỗng có gì đó sâu bên trong tui trào lên, và tui trào nước mắt trở lại... sau 3-4 năm (suốt cấp 3) tưởng mình đã "vô cảm".
				- Từ đó tui khóc trở lại nhưng là khóc vì thế sự, vì thấy nỗi khố của "thế gian", của "người khác". Nếu ngày trước khóc vì mình thì chỉ thút thít, nghẹn ngào tí thôi, thì giờ khóc vì thế sự nó mạnh hơn gấp trăm ngàn lần, không thể thút thít mà phải lăn lộn, khóc ngất.
				- Không thể kể hết được, nhưng có thể điểm vài sự kiện nổi bật như vầy:
					- Hồi mới học xong 1 năm tiếng Nhật, trong một buổi quay về KTX ĐH Ngoại ngữ Osaka để đón đàn em mới qua, tình cờ tui đọc mẩu truyện về thần y Tuệ Tĩnh của nước Nam vẫn còn ngôi mộ lưu vong trên đất Bắc, tui đã khóc lăn lộn từ trên giường xuống sàn, leo lên giường lại té xuống sàn! Câu ngài để lại trên bia mộ ghi tiếng Hán với ý "có ai đi từ nước Nam sang, xin mang di cốt tôi về với!"
					- Lúc về VN, khi coi cuốn phim tài liệu "Home" về ngôi nhà Trái Đất, từ mấy tỷ năm hình thành vô cơ, mấy trăm triệu năm hình thành cữu cơ, mấy triệu năm hình thành con người, và mấy trăm năm con người đã "ngốn sạch" di sản ngàn xưa đó... tui đã khóc ngất.
					- Gần đây nhứt là khi coi phim Buddha (Cuộc đời đức Phật) của tỷ phú Modi mới ra, ngay tập đầu tiên tui đã khóc lăn lộn cho tới hết nửa đầu nói về những năm trong đời của thái tử Siddhartha. Lần này thì nhờ có thực hành hít thở mà lần đầu tui cũng quán được chính cơn khóc của mình. Tui thấy & cảm lại hết thảy sự đau khổ của thái tử, và nó đã cho tui lời giải đáp hết sức rõ ràng rằng tại sao thái tử lại dứt khoát vào rừng tu khổ hạnh. Từ trước tui đã không hề phục và không tin rằng "một thái tử cả đời sung sướng, chẳng có mảy may đau khổ, từ trong cung son điện ngọc, nhung lụa êm ấm, bỗng dưng chỉ có đi ra 4 cửa thành thấy  lão - bệnh - tử - tu mà bỏ tất cả đi tu!" Và đúng như những gì tui đã nghĩ, những thứ người ta kể đó chỉ là lớp áo mỏng che đậy bên ngoài thôi, và cái đau khổ nhứt của thái tử là cảm nhận sự giả tạo, che đậy, dối trá đến tận cùng của chính phụ vương trên danh nghĩa "yêu thương". Những cung son điện ngọc đó không thể che đậy được nỗi lo sợ của chính phụ vương, không thể che đậy được thực tế là hoàng tộc đang sắp bị diệt vong... càng che đậy thì nỗi khổ càng khủng khiếp như một trái bom có vỏ càng cứng thì nổ càng to vậy.
				- Nhưng cái "khóc vì người khác" đó tui để trong nháy kép là vì bản thân tui không thấy đó là "người khác", chỉ là nói theo ngôn ngữ đại chúng thôi. Nếu mình thấy một kẻ đang giãy chết mà không thấy mình trong đó, VD như khi mình đang thù hận và muốn giết nó, thì không thể nào xót thương nó được. Nên tất cả những nỗi khổ của "người khác" đó cũng chỉ là phản chiếu nỗi khổ trong chính bản thân mình thôi. Cái này ai có trải nghiệm thì mới thấu hiểu được, bằng không thì chỉ là những con chữ vô tình thôi.
				- Sau này quán lại thì tui mới hiểu tại sao tui lại muốn tự tử một cách "vô lý" như vậy, và cái "khóc tự ái" thuở nhỏ cũng không phải "ích kỷ" như mình từng nghĩ, mà chỉ là sự bộc phát của nỗi khổ mà thôi. Những nỗi khổ đó tui đã tích tụ từ nhiều đời trước, rồi ở đầu đời này cho tới thời thanh niên, tui đã project nó ra ngoài 2 lần:
					- Lần đầu là thuở ấu thơ, chứng kiến cảnh "dĩa bay trong nhà", tui đã project ba mẹ mình ra thành người nam và người nữ tổng quát.
					- Lần sau, sau cái dậm chưn năm lớp 9, tui đã project nỗi khổ của mình ra nỗi khổ của mọi người.
				- Và tới 2015, khi bước vào làm hành giả, tui mới quay trở lại thu những "nỗi khổ thế gian" đó về chính mình, nhận thức rõ là "mình đang khổ" cái đã còn người ta có khổ hay không tính sau. Và dạo gần đây thì tui đã đi giáp vòng tròn, quay lại khóc nức nở cho chính mình, như chuyện "thân phận con đĩ nhỏ" tui kể hôm trước đó.
				- Đó kể ra thì chỉ có thể nói những sự kiện bộc lộ ra ngoài vậy thôi, chứ bên trong thì sao nói được?! Làm sao có thể diễn tả được cái sự phi lý đùng đùng rằng "mình với nó rõ ràng tách biệt nhau mà sâu bên trong lại là một" được!? 🤪
				- Hồi "lên núi" 3 tháng dịch Covid-19, tui đã thí nghiệm vụ này rồi: nhắm mắt lại cảm nhận, tui "thấy rõ" mình với nó là một, nhưng mở mắt ra thì mình cũng thấy rõ bằng cặp mắt ngoài này rằng mình tách biệt với nó. Đó là sự mâu thuẫn cơ bản, là Liar Paradox, là cỗ máy xoay tít, là động cơ của cả thế giới này.
				- Đây là cái nhìn bên trong: Cả thế giới bên ngoài chỉ là một quả cầu
					- ![Hand_with_Reflecting_Sphere.jpg](../assets/Will/story/2025-02/Hand_with_Reflecting_Sphere.jpg)
				- Đối với cái view bên trong thì cặp mắt ngoài này là đang nhìn vào trong quả cầu đó, cái gọi là "thế giới bên ngoài" chỉ là cái "chậu cá" mà thôi. Những thứ bên ngoài là tách biệt với nhau trong cái chậu cá đó nhưng được kết nối với nhau ở thế giới bên trong này. Sự ngược ngạo trong/ngoài đó giống như phim Matrix vậy.
				- Circle graph
				  collapsed:: true
					- ![Ageev_5X_circle_graph.svg.png](../assets/Will/story/2025-02/Ageev_5X_circle_graph.svg.png)
				- Hoặc nói theo dimensionalism thì thế giới bên ngoài là không gian 1D trên cái vòng tròn chu vi của circle graph, bản chất là tách biệt lẫn nhau, còn thế giới bên trong là cả cái đĩa tròn 2D bên trong chứa đựng các kết nối.
				- Thế giới vật lý bên ngoài chỉ có 3 chiều, còn thế giới thông tin bên trong thì có vô số chiều (không giới hạn). Nên "chiều không gian khác" không phải nằm bên ngoài khoảng không vũ trụ, mà nằm trong chính chúng ta, trong mỗi hạt cơ bản.
				- Cái này thì nãy giờ tui nói nhiều rồi hen. Nhưng câu hỏi có lẽ cần đổi lại là "tại sao thấy cái khổ cả thế gian mà không thấy cái sướng cả thế gian?"
				- Thực tình là tui cũng không rõ tại sao, mình chỉ thấy gì (bên trong) thì nói vậy thôi, ko thấy thì chỉ biết là không thấy chứ cũng không biết tại sao. Tui đi qua địa ngục nhiều, từ nhỏ cũng đã muốn "tham quan địa ngục xem sao" chứ chưa bao giờ muốn "tham quan thiên đàng". Thực tế trong tui nó như vậy. Còn nếu cố giải thích thì có thể nói là do nghiệp! 😆
				- Tui cũng đã thử qua các cái sướng của thế gian lẫn những vị ngọt vi tế của thiền định xuất thế gian, nhưng không có cái nào hấp dẫn tui cả, luôn thấy chỉ là mặt đối lập của cái khổ mà thôi. Nghĩa là tui luôn thấy "sướng bao nhiêu, khổ bấy nhiêu" nên không thấy nó có gì hay ho.
				- Chỉ có điều là sau này tui có áp dụng công thức đảo lại, tức "khổ bao nhiêu, sướng bấy nhiêu" cho thế giới bên ngoài để mình bớt bị vướng vào "tha ái", để không bị cuốn vào nỗi khổ của người khác.
				- Nói cách khác thì công thức "sướng = khổ" chỉ là lý thuyết, là ý thức của tui, là cái tui thấy ra, nhưng chưa phải là cái tui đã đạt được trong thực hành. Trên con đừơng thực hành thì tui vẫn thấy khổ nhiều hơn vì nó là động lực thúc đẩy mình giải thoát, là chỗ tui đang đứng, có lẽ vì những đời trước tui đã sướng nhiều rồi.

			- This diagram was drafted at the very early phase of Unithread when i meditated on Wave Equation & Einstein's Special Relativity. The first paper draft was... i'm not sure but must be before 2015.
			- The [action S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics)) in the middle of the bottom was new to me at that time. Its position in the pyramid, has shown me its importance, no less than the [principle of least action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_stationary_action).
			- Later on, after 2015 (while my mother's illness had got worse), i was used to meditate the corresponding of this pyramid with the [5 aggregates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandha)... but always with some mismatch!
				- Only recently did i find a better match between the 5 aggregates with the [effect circle](((67b183f5-dba7-4a11-8a72-3c619e3709ea))) & ((67b183f5-1cca-4473-917e-60c644dd5466)).

			- The uniform linear motion of the ((67a98760-71fa-4033-9c42-f3025d632d04)) is just an abstraction at the macro view, just the trailing history of the obop, the extensional product of the interunion between intent circles.
			  collapsed:: true
				- At the micro level, the obop “rolls on” with various interactive forces and curvatures. However the total of these forces is 0, hence no force is visible at the macro level.
				- A uniform obop is just a round circle with intrinsic curvature for **rolling motion**, but all curvatures are canceled out for a uniform linear motion of the center.
				- In brief, it's **rolling uniformly**, not sliding!
				- This intrinsic force has been observed and warned from the very early time of Uniinfo, but later on, when focusing on the interunion operation in Unithread, somehow i dismissed it for the sake of simplicity.
			- The micro-interactions within the obop, carried out by micro-obops, are the ones that mediate changes between levels of abstractions: derivatives in dynamics, layers of sustents in interunion.
			- The simplest micro-obop is the [Ω-thread loop](((67b183f5-f8fe-4b88-99c1-530fec38ae93))), the “bump” of thread like the shape of letter “capital Omega” `Ω`, the [soliton wave-packet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton), the _non-touching_ [Newton's cradle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cradle).

			  collapsed:: true
				- Various times previously, i've been deluded that when we “relax” all the curvatures of the world to restore its straightness, everything will be straight, flat, no more force!
				- No! That's plain wrong! As the subject straightens the world of objects, the subject itself will be curved accordingly, as shown in the [unwrapped planes of the polar plane](((67b541c9-3b4e-4429-8c35-9afaf9f434bf))).
				- In ((66b1cfa4-e22c-4424-bf19-a6ce4649da77)), the more curved the intent, the straighter the extent, and their total curvature is 1 (content).
				- The tangent thread is just an extension of the circles rotating. It “feels straight” or actually “curvature-free” just because the curvatures of the intent circles are abstracted.
					- The curvature-free linear space of tangent thread is just to express the conservation of content, while the cancellation of arrows cannot be expressed there due to their directions being abstracted away.
				- In other words, the total curvature is preserved!

			- Constructions like **“call D N”, “name D N”, “consider D N”, “declare D N”** are good for a short “D” but very confusing for a long description “D”, e.g. 
			  > We _call_ a system whose state changes continuously over time even if the system itself is not moving a [**dynamical system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system), in contrast to a dynamic system governed by the laws of dynamics.
			- The name “N” can easily be lost after such a long description “D”.
			- Copilot rephrased it with if/when clause:
			  > We call a system a **dynamical system** _when_ its whose state changes continuously over time even if the system itself is not moving, in contrast to a dynamic system governed by the laws of dynamics.
			- Or better with passive voice:
			  > A system whose state changes continuously over time even if the system itself is not moving is _called_ a **dynamical system**, in contrast to a dynamic system governed by the laws of dynamics.
			- Or simply use a direct description:
			  > A **dynamical system** _is_ a system whose state changes continuously over time even if the system itself is not moving. This is to contrast with a dynamic system governed by the laws of dynamics.
			- Instead, we can use other constructions like **“refer to D as N”, “regard D as N”, “consider D to be N”, “declare D to be N”**, etc.
			- Actually, i've used the old-fashioned **“consider D as N”** throughout my docs.
				- The old fashion: From [The Britannica Dictionary](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/eb/qa/consider-and-consider-as), Merriam-Webster's Concise Dictionary of English Usage states: “[consider] as constructions are perfectly idiomatic but are not as common in recent use as they have been in the past. Nonetheless, they are still in use and are standard.”
				- The matter gets complicated with [more in-depth discussion about “consider as” on BringMeTheNews](https://bringmethenews.com/life/instagrammar-please-please-stop-saying-considered-as):
					- The New York Times' headline “[Headquarters Of The Times Is Considered As Landmark](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/21/nyregion/headquarters-of-the-times-is-considered-as-landmark.html)” should be “Headquarters Of The Times Is Considered A Landmark”, isn't it?! 😁
					- Someone said that “We suggest tool B to be considered _as_ another approach to solving the problem” sounds better than without “as”. 🤔

			- A "circle of dynamic" refers to *a conceptual model that represents a continuous, cyclical process where elements within a system are constantly interacting, changing, and influencing each other*, often signifying a state of ongoing movement and evolution, much like the circular motion of a wheel.
			- Key points about the "circle of dynamic":
				- **Symbolic representation:** The circle itself symbolizes wholeness, completion, and interconnectedness, implying that all parts of the system are interdependent.
				- **Continual change:** Within the circle, elements are not static but are constantly in flux, moving through different stages or phases of a cycle.
				- **Feedback loops:** The dynamic nature often involves feedback loops, where the outcome of one action influences the next, creating a continuous cycle of adaptation and adjustment.
			- Examples of "circle of dynamic" in different contexts:
				- **Business:** A business cycle could be seen as a circle of dynamic, with stages like product development, launch, growth, maturity, and decline, eventually leading back to innovation and new product development.
				- **Personal development:** A personal growth cycle might include setting goals, taking action, reflecting on progress, adjusting strategies, and repeating the process.
				- **Ecology:** The food chain in an ecosystem can be considered a circle of dynamic, with producers creating food for consumers, who then become food for predators, eventually returning nutrients back to the soil.
			- A "circle of dynamics" refers to *a concept in mathematics, particularly within the field of dynamical systems, where the state space is represented as a circle*, meaning the system's behavior is analyzed within the constraints of a circular boundary, often used to model periodic or cyclical phenomena like rotations or oscillations.
			- Key points about circle dynamics:
				- **Simple space:** The circle provides a relatively simple one-dimensional space to study complex dynamics, making it a valuable tool for understanding fundamental concepts in dynamical systems.
				- **Rotation number:** A crucial concept in circle dynamics, the rotation number describes the average "winding" of a point on the circle as it evolves through time under the dynamical system.
				- **Applications:** Circle dynamics finds applications in various fields including physics (e.g., planetary motion), biology (e.g., circadian rhythms), and engineering (e.g., oscillator systems).
			- Example of a circle dynamics system:
				- **Rotating wheel:** Imagine a point on a spinning wheel - its movement can be modeled as a circle dynamics system, where the rotation angle represents the state and the rotation speed determines the dynamics.

Còn "Luang·por Jiew" là tên thân mật, nghĩa là "ba nhỏ đáng kính" (luang = đáng kính, por = ba/cha, jiew = nhỏ bé), nghe rất là thân thương với ai biết tiếng Thái.
						  
						  Mong anh tinh tấn tu tập với thầy Jiew để lấy lại tâm định tĩnh, có định tĩnh rồi thì trí tuệ mình mới mở ra cho mọi suy nghĩ sáng suốt được. Khi có suy nghĩ sáng suốt rồi thì làm gì cũng tốt. Còn bây giờ mình đổ nhiệt huyết vào "giúp thầy MT" mà tâm mình đang rối rắm thì vô hình trung chẳng giúp được mà lại hoá ra hại, hại cả mình lẫn người ta nữa.
						  
						  Chúc anh Báu tinh tấn!

				  Hôm nay sau 1 giấc ngủ dài, tui đi tâm hành dạng life review. Trong nhiều cảnh chạy qua, hầu hết là cảnh đời thường, thì có 1 cảnh đậm triết lý nên share ông nè:
				- Trong một cảnh kiểu như từ trên nhìn xuống, thấy rất nhiều người, có một tiếng nói vọng ra:
					- 12 ngàn công nhân này cũng không bằng...
					- AVERAGE! -- Đùng 1 cái từ trên trời rơi xuống 1 chữ "average" cảm giác rất nặng, như 1 tảng đá từ trên trời rơi xuống vậy. Average ở đây là kẻ đại diện cho cả 12 ngàn công nhân kia, là ông vua, ông boss thực chất (có ruột, chứ không phải chỉ là 1 hình thức rỗng ruột)
				- Cái cảnh này chỉ diễn ra trong chớp mắt, nhưng diễn tả ra thì nó dài dòng như vậy đó
				- Nó nhắc nhở tui rằng cái tâm vòng tròn đại diện cho cả vòng tròn, rằng kẻ đứng đầu thực thụ, và những cái form kết tinh của content (chưa rỗng ruột) cũng quan trọng và có sức nặng không kém gì số đông contents kia. Đó là vì sâu thẳm trong tui luôn hướng về đại chúng bình dân, luôn coi thường mấy tên boss 😁
				- Ngày xưa tui còn ghét hết thảy bọn vua chúa, chủ tịch, tổng thống, lớp trưởng, lớp phó đồ 😁
				- Nhưng rồi đó cũng chỉ là một cảnh trong rất nhiều cảnh khác, những lần khóc ngất khi nghĩ về dân tộc, nhân loại đồ cũng chỉ là một giấc mơ... trong rất nhiều giấc mơ... Và nhìn về phía trước, thấy chút nữa thôi mình lại phải tiếp tục bước vào một giấc mơ mà mình biết chắc là nó sẽ cuốn mình đi xa... tui cảm thấy hơi ngán... Nhưng rồi nghe tiếng vợ ngáp... À thì bả tỉnh dậy 1 chút rồi, mình cũng tranh thủ đưa bả đi ăn để về bả còn ngủ tiếp, ngủ bù sau trận cày bán hoa lễ 8/3 mà...
				- Thế là mở mắt ra, tui bước vào giấc mơ... và tui đang nhắn cho ông đây cũng trong cái giấc mơ đó. Ha ha, kẻ mở cặp mắt ngoài thì biểu kẻ nhắm mắt là mơ, kẻ mở con mắt trong (thường nhắm mắt ngoài) thì lại thấy kẻ mở mắt thao láo kia là đang mơ 😁

				- At the end of working hours today, it became worse due to the pressure of both personal works and company works.
			- Saturday, 15 March, with meditation, i shifted the sore throat to phlegm.
			- Sunday, the phlegm seemed to be under control. From 18:00, i took 1 tab of 200μg LSD to see what will be seen while i'm sick.
				- There's nothing strange.
				- In stead of deeper meditation into my lungs as i expected, the trip let me go around the overview circle where this sickness is just an essential part. So just enjoy it, enjoy the caugh, no need to take it seriously.
				- Next day (Monday), instead of going to hospital, i decided to share this view on liberation and about "the ultimate result is sickness and dead" with leader Quân.
				- I went to bed to relax my back, where i saw that "just shift the (inner deep) focus, the cough will subside."
			- Monday, i went to company to wrap up the "Java heap" task with Mr. Phương, and returned right in that morning because leader Quân was off.
				- There are many ones coughing in the company and many ones off for sickness. So i'm not alone! 😁
				- Afternoon, waking up after some hours sleeping, i reviewed and saw the cause of my severe cough was the “phase locking”:
					- Attachment (chấp) = phase locking/synch just like hiccup
						- The ((667c0031-0a87-44c9-9e98-6d45893b095f)) generated by observing the breath locks the cough in phase.
					- Driving = phase shifting via sampling change & continuation (aliasing)
						- Coarse grained version of resampling is ignoring which is usually done by people.
						- The normal (subjective) way is to shift focus.
						- [Âm dương đan](((67dce5ed-429b-4279-9fb4-7bf78ddd649a)))

						- [(ir)rational rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_rotation) + coupling (sine) wave = Arnold circle map
							- (ir)rational rotation: for each turn of the intent circle $i → i+1$, it covers the content $x_{i+1} - x_{i} = Ω$, an (ir)rational number relative to the content circle (= 1).
							- coupling wave: $\frac{K}{2π} \sin(2π x_{i})$ is the “breathing” obop
							- Arnold circle map: $θ_{i+1} - θ_{i} = 2πΩ + K \sin(θ_{i})$ where $θ = 2πx$

						- The general circle map $θ_{i+1} = g(θ_{i}) + Ω$ is just a general quasiperiodic function $g$ between intent circle & content circle.
						- The [rotation number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_number) is the “frequency” of content cycle over intent turns.
						  $ω = \lim_{n \to ∞} x_{n}/n ≈ Ω$
							- It's also the [winding number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winding_number) of the intent thread around the content circle.

			- Tuesday, i practised âm dương đan the whole day and also advertised it to leader Quân.
				- Going to bed, i found the mental switch to turn the [cough reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough_reflex) off: while still facing the cough, zoom out and hold on other stuffs to pull the mind out of the cough.
				- After 4 hours, i woke up and returned to bed with the same technique... and contemplated the [equivalence of 2 aspects of the zero](((67dcec86-db94-47b0-8687-ab2aa95d7c8a))) before falling asleep.

				- This early morning, i saw the equivalence of 2 aspects of the zero: 
				  id:: 67dcec86-db94-47b0-8687-ab2aa95d7c8a
				  Zero = center = balance = cancellation = concentration = abstraction = point (cone) projection
					- obop = ε =[projection]= 1/ω =[cancellation]= ω - ω
					- Wider the world 🌎 ω, there are more opposites to be cancelled, leaving less things to see as ε, nearer to the center, the average.
					- To return to the center, we must zoom out, back up/off, retreat, refrain, to let the opposites within the objects cancel themselves, instead of going forward to control them, and let the form of the objects recede themselves.
				- From afternoon to midnight, i researched various themes in which the most prominent one is the [homogeneous coordinates](((67dcf2d3-4020-4477-b375-9bbb8c0b1336))) at last.
				- Due to being caught up in these researches, i was fallen into severe coughs again.

			- Thursday, a day of meditation.
				- With deep meditation, my cough had nearly gone before i went to bed.

			- Today, Monday 24 March, back to the company, i'm completing the theories in the previous days.
				- Before sleep, in the restroom, i recalled the property “everything is a rotation”:
					- Every change is just a transformation preserving content.
					- The unchanged content is the “radius” of the rotation making it turn around.
					- The change of the visible forms (yang) is always balanced by the complementary change of the invisible forms (yin).
					- So, every change is a group action.
				- Going to bed, there was no more cough reflex.... but just nearly 3 hours later, the cough emerged from the sleep.
					- I dealt with it until morning, hence only 3 hours sleep!

				- Created ((67e299fa-4f76-482a-b586-adacb17dc064))

					  id:: 67e37475-13e3-4a9f-af60-7bec7517c108

Moreover, the projective nature of conic sections, i.e. [“why slicing the cone”](https://www.geogebra.org/m/nknaryzz), was discovered much later, only when i studied projective geometry (2020).
					- History of graphing of functions, loci of relations (curves), and trajectories of objects
					  collapsed:: true
						- The invention of function graphing on orthogonal coordinates is closely tied to the development of **analytic geometry**, which emerged in the 17th century, but it has precursors from medieval maths.
						- Nicole Oresme (1323–1382), a medieval mathematician, made earlier contributions by [visualizing quantities as geometric representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme#Mathematics), which can be seen as precursors to modern graphing.
						- René Descartes (1596–1650) is often credited with formalizing the use of orthogonal coordinates (the [Cartesian plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_plane)) in his work *La Géométrie* (1637), where he introduced the idea of representing algebraic equations as geometric curves.
						- Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665) independently developed similar ideas around the same time. Fermat worked on a treatise titled *Ad locus planos et solidos isagoge*, which outlined concepts of analytic geometry, but he did not publish his work widely.
					- History of vector analysis
					  collapsed:: true
						- Newton and Leibniz utilized Cartesian coordinates to develop the calculus of differential and integral, laying groundwork for the field of vector analysis, like the [parallelogram law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram_law) in *Principia Mathematica* (1687), and for linear algebra, like the solution of linear systems by Leibniz in 1693.
						- By the end of 18th century and early 19th century, [complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number) was brought to the Cartesian plane, called [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane), by Caspar Wessel (1797), Jean-Robert Argand (1806), and Carl Friedrich Gauss (early 19th century).
							- Ironically, while Descartes gave the name “[imaginary number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number)” to $i$, he didn't put complex numbers onto his own Cartesian plane!
						- Hamilton invented the [quaternion numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) (1843), extending the complex numbers, to handle mechanics in 3D space properly, esp. the 3D rotation and [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
						- In 1844 Hermann Grassmann published his "Theory of Extension" founding the modern [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) with "inner product" for [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) and "outer product" for [exterior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_product). Because his theory predated vector calculus, he use terms like “stretch” to call the modern notion of “vector”.
						- Near the end of the 19th century, Gibbs and Heaviside simplified the 4D quaternions to create the [vector calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus) for 3D space, as shown in the book *Vector Analysis* (1901). This was in parallel with the development of [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) for linear algebra by Peano in 1888 and Salvatore Pincherle in 1897.

						- Traditionally, the relationship between quantities, e.g. (x, y), is usually decribed with function, e.g. $y = f(x)$, or more generally with relation, e.g. $R(x, y) = 0$, both of which can be plotted on the Cartesian plane xOy as a graph (of function) or a curve (of relation). There, each quantity is expressed by an orthogonal axis.
							- This curve corresponds to the **projective thread**, the elementary thread in Unithread, which shows a **distribution** (static relation) of these quantities.
						- However, ((66ac41f1-de0c-48cb-a9b0-c30b0fe27c5d)) focus more on relative & dynamic relations which are usually expressed as the relative angles between the elementary threads of these quantities.
							- Relativity:
								- The angles show how much they are apart/different from each other.
								- In reverse, the scalar product of the direction vectors shows the correlation between them.
								- The relativity is shown by the mutual distance, mutual angle, scalar product, mutual stretch in shearing, etc.
							- All these threads are combined into a **compound thread** by synchronizing points, which are called [coincidences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(geometry)), knots, contact points, etc.
							  id:: 684f951a-1db2-4e43-9c5a-f4fbd27fe667
							- When the compound thread is projected to different lines and curves (spaces in general), the images are projective threads showing different distributions of these quantities in different spaces.
						- Around 2018, i used scalar product of vectors to map the projective thread.
							- This creates the map with the angle/slope between quantities smaller than the slope of the graph $y = f(x)$: As the mapped angle varies from 0° to 90°, the slope of the corresponding graph varies from 45° to 90°.
							- While having different slopes, the projective thread is equivalent to the function graph, actually the graph of distribution.

							- Diagram of vector relativity
								- ![vector-relativity.jpg](../assets/Will/story/2025-03/vector-relativity.jpg)
							- The original Vietnamese version
								- Lâu lâu 2 ông cụ nhà mình mới có dịp gặp nhau, ấy thế mà nói được vài câu là đã mâu thuẫn rồi:
									- Ô.Ngoại: Tôi đi được 3 mét rồi ông mới đi được có 1 mét. Sao ông đi chậm vậy?!
									- Ô.Nội: Mỗi bước tôi đi được 3 tấc còn ông mỗi bước chỉ được có 1 tấc. Sao ông bước ngắn thế?!
									- Ô.Ngoại: Tôi bước ngắn nhưng mà nhanh, ông so từng bước thế sao được?! Trong lúc ông bước được một bước 3 tấc của ông thì tôi đã bước được 9 bước, tức là 9 tấc rồi. Rốt cuộc tôi vẫn hơn! 😃
									- Ô.Nội: Đó chỉ là số đo bên ngoài thôi! Mình phải biết tiết kiệm sức chứ: Này nhé, tôi bước dài và chậm còn ông bước ngắn và nhanh nên một bước của tôi cũng tốn sức bằng với một bước của ông thôi. Nếu như trong một chuyến đi, nếu mình đủ sức cho 1000 bước, thì ông đi được 100 mét đã mệt, còn tôi đi được tới 300 mét mới mệt. 🙂
								- ... Nói qua nói lại, ai cũng có cái hay riêng của người đó, nên rốt cuộc chẳng ai hơn ai. Ấy gọi là "tương đối" vậy. 😉 Như trên sơ đồ bên dưới, thực ra ông Ngoại (Ps) và ông Nội (Pt) đều nằm trên cùng một vòng tròn, chỉ lệch nhau một góc mà thôi. Nhưng nếu đem "ông kia" chiếu lên trục của "ông này" thì bên nào cũng thấy bên kia chỉ bằng có 1/3 của mình mà thôi.
							- Every now and then, the two grandfathers in my family get a chance to meet. But no sooner do they exchange a few words than they find themselves in disagreement:
								- Ma.Granny: I've already walked 3 meters while you've only managed 1 meter. Why are you so slow?!
								- Pa.Granny: Well, with each step, I cover 30 centimeters, while you only manage 10 centimeters per step. Why are your steps so short?!
								- Ma.Granny: My steps are short but fast; you can't compare step by step like that! While you take one of your long 30-centimeter strides, I take 9 short steps, covering a total of 90 centimeters. In the end, I'm still ahead! 😃
								- Pa.Granny: That’s just an external measurement! One must conserve their energy. Look here, I take long and slow strides, while you take short and rapid ones. In terms of effort, one of my steps requires just as much energy as one of yours. So, in a journey where we have the energy for 1000 steps, you'd only manage 100 meters before getting tired, whereas I'd cover 300 meters before tiring out. 🙂
							- ... Back and forth they go, each with their own perspective and merits. In the end, neither is better than the other. It's what we call "relativity." 😉 As shown in the diagram below, in reality, Maternal Grandfather (Ps) and Paternal Grandfather (Pt) both lie on the same circle, only separated by an angle. But if one were to project "the other" onto their axis, each would only see the other as a third of themselves.
						- In Novemeber 2022, i contemplated the continuous transformation, i.e. [homotopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy), from X to Y of the projective thread which is defined by the function $f: X → Y$ as a projection from the uniform object thread Y to the uniform screen thread X.
							- The homotopy can be extended to a [chain of functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition) $\cdots∘f_3∘f_2∘f_1: X_0 → X_1 → X_2 → X_3 → \cdots$, which will be a [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(mathematics)) $[φ(t) = f^t](x)$.
							- The flow $φ(t)$ in orthogonal coordinates xOy is a generalized rotation (circular flow) around the origin O, where $t$ is the argument (phase) of the rotation. $t$ is also the exponent of the [functional power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition#Functional_powers), and is the scaling factor of the argument of the [exponential map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_map_(Lie_theory)) $\exp(t⋅X) = φ(t)$.
							- That time, i intended to to put my idea down with the applet [TopoMorph](https://www.geogebra.org/m/mekmjqcg), but got stuck there... until now.
							- Now, April 24, 2025, i roll it out with the applet [ProjectiveThreadViews](https://www.geogebra.org/m/t4hanww4).
						- In October 2024, i saw how the ((670cdcb4-3c85-45af-8c30-3c3284ed37df)) projects the classical function graph to the projective thread.
				- The sleep was better:

					- no cough at the onset;
					- one cough reflex emerged after more than 2 hours but i managed to calm it down easily to continue the sleep;
					- one wake up in the early morning for urination and contiue to sleep.
						- This time, my wife fell into a sharp cold. I turned the fan off and reminded her to concentrate on the breath. With concentration and warm keeping, she could stablize it finally.
			- Wednesday, the cough in sleep has gone.

				- I worked out the decomposition of hyperbolic rotation into 3 shears and asked Grok 3 to help. Finally we had the conclusion of [a nice symmetry](((67e6168e-ff58-4d9d-94a7-6fee6f533044))).
				- 3 hours into the sleep, i woke up to cough... no more phlegm, only thick clear mucus. It's so sticky in my throat that i's about the vomit, just like the first days of this illness.
					- The cough reflex kicked in and persisted... I meditated to calm it down.
					- After half an hour dealing with the cough, i lay down to sleep but got sleepy for just an hour and then woke up.
					- From then on, i has been godly awake (thức thần) after my meditation entering the “dead state”!
					  id:: 67e62305-1f02-4945-836b-f3984e1f0e45
					- Then i called my wife up to share with her the meditative state. I guided her to review her own state: she discovered that she had been heavy, not as “normal” as she thought. She relaxed, reviewed, and we had sex before i went to work.

				- While sitting at the riverside, i contemplated the relativity of lengths in the parabolic rotation as well as the unity of the three conic rotations.
					- I saw the CIE in the right triangle where the selection of 2 edges yielding circular, parabolic, and hyperbolic rotation. It's discussed in ((67ee2e11-9371-4290-94c0-95f2e5bf8c54)).
					- Hence, the three conic rotations are unified beautifully under the views of ((66ac41f1-de0c-48cb-a9b0-c30b0fe27c5d)).
					- I also saw my urge to see with eyes the seemingly “impossible” equivalence between triple of shears and circular rotation.

						- Many experiences were on the trips of Ketamine, LSD, DMT and 5MEO-DMT.
						- One notable [death & dissolution of ego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death) was thanks to the exhaustion after a week of stubborn trial to build the “quicklog” system and the last night sleepless from Saturday (22th May) to Sunday (23rd).

							- Trong nhật ký thì mình chỉ nhắc đến nó trong một vế trong một câu vào dịp Covid-19, [ngày 30/7/2021](http://tamsudoithuong.blogspot.com/2021/07/200-hom-thu-2-minh-lo-thuc-tu-toi-hom.html) mà thôi:

								- Mới hồi bầu cử tháng trước đó, tui viết một cái trang web nhỏ thôi "quicklog" nhưng gặp nhiều vấn đề ngoài dự tính của mình... nó cuốn mình đi...
								- lần này nó chỉ cuốn tui đi có 1 đêm Thứ 7 đến sáng CN thôi, sáng đó tui vẫn đủ sức đi bầu cử nữa mà...
								- nhưng buông ra, nằm vật xuống ngủ tới chiều... lúc mở mắt ra, à ko, tỉnh bên trong nhưng còn nhắm mắt... thì tui chứng nghiệm sự hoà nhập với vạn vật: cảm nhận từng rung động nhỏ, bên ngoài cũng như bên trong, như mỗi lỗ chân lông là một con mắt, một cái tai vậy
								- lúc đó mình hoàn toàn ko còn cái tôi nào hết, những ý muốn, ý định chỉ là những ý tồn tại ở đó thôi, nó ko phải là mình
								- những cảm nhận, những cái thấy biết hiện tại đến từ bên trong lẫn bên ngoài ... có thể gọi là mình, nhưng thực ra cũng ko có cảm giác "mình" trong đó, nó chỉ là những luồng thông tin, như những làn gió, những dòng nước vậy thôi
								- khi mình nhập vào một làn gió thì mình trở thành làn gió đó vậy; thế là để ngồi dậy, tui nhập tâm vào thân thể này và vào ý định ngồi dậy
								- lúc đó mình làm cái gì cũng cảm nhận rõ, thấy rõ những luồng tín hiệu từ trên xuống chỉ đạo ra sao, phản ứng dưới cơ thể thế nào, bị cuốn vào ngoại cảnh và vào những ý muốn của mình thế nào, v.v.
								- kiểu như mình cho chạy trương trình trong mode debug vậy
								- ==> Đó là chứng nghiệm đầu tiên nhắc tui quay lại hướng tập "xả" dạo này
								- hồi đó giờ tui "debug" thân tâm này toàn bằng sự tập trung quan sát, tui nhập định cũng bằng sự tập trung tư tưởng
								- mới mấy hôm trước, trong 1 chuyến tâm hành trên giường, tui cũng đã nhập định được nhờ xả: sau khi cho tự động life review... review đâu hết 3 tiếng rưỡi... thì tự nhiên nhập định hoà với vạn vật 🙂

				- It's interesting that the [story of Pukkusati](((67ea1006-7d4b-4ac6-ba9e-80eaa1e9c19a))) clearly shows that both Gotama Buddha and ven. Pukkusati spent most of the night time in the [lotus position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_position) just like [master Minh Tuệ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Minh_Tu%E1%BB%87)'s doing nowadays. The difference may be that in that night the Buddha could spend a little time lying down instead of sitting the whole time like master Minh Tuệ.

			- Last Friday, 4th April, on the occation that Ms. Trung came to Saigon to to on-site translation, we had a quick gathering at a coffe shop.
			- Saturday morning, i met Mr. Hiệp to have deeper sharings, where i suggested him to use his sleep to contemplate his unconsciousness.
			- Then i continue to share various themes on chat room:
				- Hôm qua ông Hiệp có nói vụ “*làm chủ sanh lão bệnh tử*”, nay tui tán dóc về chủ đề này nhé 😁
				  collapsed:: true
					- Từ ngữ thiệt lắt léo: nó chẳng phải là "làm chủ" theo kiểu ra lệnh của ông chủ bắt đầy tớ phải làm theo ý mình một cách bất chấp (theo ý Tôi), mà "làm chủ" theo kiểu "mình nói bạn nghe và làm theo". Nên tui thường thay "làm chủ" bằng "làm bạn" hay tốt hơn nữa là "làm mình".
					- Khi làm chủ bằng cái Tôi thì mình dùng sức, dùng quyền, dùng tiền, dùng năng lượng, dùng phước nói chung để bắt kẻ khác, và bắt thân thể phải tuân lệnh của mình. Nó có tác dụng khi nào mình còn phước.
					- Còn với những kẻ hết phước thì có cách "làm chủ" khác: lắng nghe thế thấu hiểu, thấu cảm, thông cảm thì nói ra những lời (ko phải mệnh lệnh) hợp tình hợp lý, khiến đối phương thấy được đồng cảm nên tu8 nhiên nghe theo.
					  Mình nói với chính bản thân mình cũng y như vậy thôi.
					- Cái chỗ "nói nghe" hay không thì ai có quán thân tâm rồi sẽ biết: càng muốn làm chủ theo tiểu ngã thì càng "trên bảo dưới không nghe". Như người nam có một cái "chưn" mà muốn nó lên thì dễ nhưng bảo nó xuống thì khó 😜 Nó cho thấy "free will" là một thứ rất ảo tưởng của con người: mình làm nô lệ 99%, làm chủ cùng lắm được 1%
					- Đợt viên phổi vừa rồi, lần 2 tui được quán "chết đuối" nên "làm chủ" được nhiều hơn. Cái phản xạ của cơ thể để giành lại "sự sống" mà nó quen thuộc đó mạnh khủng khiếp, không có mệnh lệnh nào điều khiển được nó
					- Và nghịch lý là: muốn "làm chủ" cái phản xạ gần như hoàn toàn tự động đó, mình lại phải "nhập vào cõi chết", tức hoàn toàn buông ra xụi lơ.
					  Đó gọi là ego death
					  Và ở trong "cõi chết" đó mình lại thấy mọi thứ rõ ràng nhứt, chứ không hề "tối thui, không còn thấy biết gì nữa" như mọi người tưởng về cái chết.
					- Khoa học gọi cái mình không thể điều khiển trực tiếp bên trong đó là vô thức, bên Phật gọi là nghiệp, nó mới là thứ quyết định mọi thứ của mình và cho mình cái cảm giác "tự chủ"
					- Hiep Bobo Do:
					  cụ thể là phản xạ gì? mlusc viêm phổi
					  sao lại giống chết đuoi?
						- Toàn thân: khi ông không thở được thì toàn thân nổi dậy
						  Từ sâu dưới bụng tới cơ ngực co thắt để ho để tống cái thứ nó nghĩ là đang chặn đường thở của mình
						  Khi đờm không đặc cục mà nhầy kéo ra bịt cả cuống họng thì phản xạ ói để tống nó ra
					- Những phản xạ đó là những chương trình được lập từ mấy chục triệu năm trước, là nghiệp sâu dày hơn những thói quen mình tích lũy trong đời này nhiều.
					  Nghiệp chỉ là sự tích lũy của hành động: làm nhiều riết quen, thành thói quen, phản ứng, rồi phản xạ, rồi truyền từ đời này qua đời khác.
					  Cả những phản ứng khi mình thích hay ghét cái gì đó cũng là nghiệp tích tụ mà thôi
					  Nó tích lũy qua nhiều dạng khác nhau, trong tâm là quan niệm, định kiến, về thọ là những cảm giác cảm xúc, về sinh lý là những phản xạ, hormones, gene, v.v.
				- Và khi gọi cái khối nghiệp đó là "**vô thức**" thì nó thể hiện sự **vô minh** của mình, không y thức được về những gì có trong đó, nên nó diễn ra một cách tự động ngoài khả năng kiểm soát của mình, tức mình không "làm chủ" được nó.
				  collapsed:: true
					- Quay lại việc quán cái khối nghiệp, cái cỗ máy vô thức đó, thì hôm nay tui chia sẻ về giấc ngủ. Vì khi ngủ là ý thức bị tắt nên vô thức hiện rõ nhứt, cụ thể là qua giấc mơ (nên mới có kỹ thuật giải mộng để biết về những thứ tiềm ẩn bên trong).
					- Hồi lúc tập tỉnh giác trong giấc ngủ thì tui nằm thiền rồi đi vào giấc ngủ luôn, và khi thức dậy cũng không vội mở mắt mà cũng tranh thủ khoảng giao giữa ngủ với thức đó để thiền quán.
					- Tui viết [bài này](https://creatzynotes.blogspot.com/2013/06/cuoc-hoi-ngo-voi-con-ma-bong-e-sau-hai.html#self-through-sensation) về giấc mơ và bóng đè từ 12 năm trước, và cập nhật phần "Cái Tôi qua các cảm giác và ý thức" vào năm 2015 thời An Lạc Trang. Trong đó có tả trải nghiệm khi chuẩn bị thức dậy, và 2 thí nghiệm thú vị về cảm giác "tôi" và ảo giác "tôi ra quyết định, tôi lựa chọn".
					  cái Tôi đó chỉ là tập hợp của 5 thứ cảm giác (từ mắt, tai, mũi, lưỡi, thân) và tâm thức của mình mà thôi.
					- Về phần cảm giác thì [thí nghiệm cánh tay giả](https://youtu.be/xdxlT68ygt8) cho thấy rõ cái mình cho rằng "tay mình" chỉ là một ảo giác

					- Còn phần tâm ý thì [thí nghiệm Libet](https://youtu.be/VnGDrc_s6KA) từ những năm 1980 (cỡ tuổi mình) đã cho thấy rõ là "quyết định" của mình, hay đúng hơn là thứ mà ý thức mình cho rằng "tôi đã chọn làm việc này", lại bị người ngoài "bắt mạch" biết trước cả 1-2 giây trước khi mình tự biết là mình sẽ chọn cái nào.
					  collapsed:: true
						- {{video https://youtu.be/VnGDrc_s6KA}}
					- Những thứ mình nghĩ là mình chọn, mình quyết định, thường là do đầu óc mình nói lên *sau khi* nó nhận ra là cỗ máy vô thức đã và đang làm điều gì đó: như khi tai mình nghe một lời nào nó chạm phải cái vết thương nào trong lòng thì phản ứng bên trong là nó tự động bật lại, hoặc né tránh, rồi thường là sau khi lời nói hành động phản ứng của mình diễn ra thì ý thức mới nhận ra và thực hiện nhiệm vụ của nó là rationalize "mình quyết định phải làm như vậy là vì abc, xyz..."
					  Nên cái free will đó phần lớn là illusion.
					- Qua những chuyến khám phá khu rừng bên trong, tui thấy cả một hệ sinh thái nghiệp ở trong đó, cũng có những tảng đá nghìn năm triệu năm cứng y như những tảng đá núi bên ngoài thế giới vật chất này. Cũng có cây cổ thụ ngàn năm lẫn những dây leo chỉ có vài năm tuổi (thói quen mới) những lại quấn chằng chịt với những cây cổ thụ kia.
					- Tuy theo cái nhìn từ thế giới vật chất vào trong thì cả thảy khu rừng nghiệp và cái Tôi đó đều là "ảo", nhưng nó lại rất thực đối với bên trong. Còn nhìn từ trong tâm ra thì cả thế giới vật chất này cũng "ảo lòi", và cũng chỉ là những nghiệp bên ngoài mà thôi. 😁
					- > thấy bất kỳ cái gì cũng ý thức rõ ràng "đây chỉ là hình ảnh", khi nghe bất kỳ điều gì cũng ý thức rõ ràng "đây chỉ là âm thanh".
					  
					  Đoạn này mình viết từ 10 năm trước mà sau này mới biết Đức Phật cũng đã từng chỉ cách quán cho Bahiya y như vậy:
					  > Này Bahiya, Ông cần phải học tập như sau: "Trong cái thấy, sẽ chỉ là cái thấy. Trong cái nghe, sẽ chỉ là cái nghe. Trong cái thọ tưởng, sẽ chỉ là cái thọ tưởng. Trong cái thức tri, sẽ chỉ là các thức tri ". Do vậy, này Bahiva, ông không là (người ở) chỗ ấy, ông không là (người ở) đời này, cũng không ở đời sau. (Tức là không có cái Tôi nào như ông vẫn tưởng.)
					  Nhờ lời thuyết pháp tóm tắt này của Thế Tôn, tâm của Bahiya được giải thoát khỏi các lậu hoặc, không có chấp thủ. (Đắc quả arahant)

				  vạy có thấy đc là "nó" đang phản xạ còn mình đứng ngoài ngó chơi?
					- Ông tưởng tượng hơi quá. Ông đã tập nín thở rồi, ông có thấy "như đứng ngoài chơi" không 😁
					- Mình với nó (phản xạ) không hề tách biệt, tui không thấy một cái "mình" nào ngoài cái mớ cảm giác và chuỗi phản xạ kéo theo sau đó. Ban đầu thì có vẻ tách biệt: phần ý thức thì biết là "trong đó đã hết dịch rồi, không còn gì để tống ra đâu" nên tìm cách nói chuyện với phần phản xạ vô thức. Nhưng sau đó, càng quán nó, thì ý thức càng nhập vào làm 1 với nó, như lặn xuống đáy hồ thì mình cảm thấy là 1 với cả hồ vậy. Sự hòa nhập đó là 2 chiều: ý thức thì thấy rõ hơn cơ chế của phản xạ, còn vô thức thì không còn chạy độc lập hoàn toàn tự động nữa mà dần "nghe lời" ý thức.
					- Trước khi nhập vào "cõi chết" thì tui cũng đã tìm ra một "công tắc" để tạm ngắt được nó. Nhưng chỉ một hồi sau thì nó lại tự động bật trở lại.
					- Chỉ khi nhớ lại những trải nghiệm "qua cửa tử" trong những lần trước và áp dụng vào thì nó mới dừng hẳn, mà đúng ra là mình mới dừng hẳn: mình chết tức là mình không còn phản ứng nữa, cảm giác khó chịu trong đường thở chỉ còn là cảm giác chứ không còn là trigger của phản xạ nữa. Nên hễ còn thấy "nó" thì mình còn điều khiển nó theo kiểu chủ-tớ, chỉ khi hòa làm một đều là mình thì mình mới "làm chủ" được... mình 😁. Đó là vì những gì mình cho là "mình" thực ra rất xa cách với ý thức của mình, mình chẳng thấu hiểu, chẳng cảm gì được nó. Giống như 1 ông vua coi cả nước là "của trẫm" nhưng chỉ biết có cái cung son điện ngọc thôi chứ chẳng hề biết dân tình khổ sở ra sao, nhưng hễ còn phước của tiên đế thì ra lệnh còn có kẻ nghe lời, nên còn giữ được cảm giác rằng "cả thiên hạ là của trẫm" 😁
					- Cái thấy của cặp mắt ngoài là cái thấy phân biệt "object vs subject", và nó ăn sâu vào tâm trí mình khiến mình luôn cảm giác "nó không phải là mình". Vì bức tường ngăn cách nó với mình nên mình mới không thấu hiểu, không thông cảm, mới có thể làm theo ý mình bất chấp nó ra sao. Bức tường đó là sự vô minh. Nhưng vô minh lớn nhứt lại là vô minh về chính mình, như ông vua vô minh về chính thần dân của mình vậy.
					- Nên mới cần tập cái thấy bên trong, thường gọi là cái "thức", là cái thấy không phân biệt. Nên dùng cái kinh nghiệm thấy bên ngoài để tưởng tượng về cái thấy bên trong thì chỉ như khỉ nghĩ về "cá leo cây ra sao" mà thôi.
					- Thấy thấu suốt chính mình thì lại tự nhiên thấu hiểu người khác hơn, vì chúng ta vốn là 1 bên trong, và những người khác nhau này chỉ là chính mình mặc những bộ áo da khác nhau để diễn những vai khác nhau mà thôi.
					- Tóm lại, vòng xoáy "nó - mình" mà tui đã trải qua như sau:
						- 1. Làm một người thường ở đời, mình thấy cái thân này, cảm xúc này, ý nghĩ này là mình, còn cái thân kia, lời nói kia, ý nghĩ kia là "nó".
						- 2. Khi hết năng lượng hoặc đau bệnh, mình buộc phải quay về chính mình thì mình nhận ra những thứ mình cho là "mình" đó lại chẳng hề là mình: nó chẳng chịu nghe lời mình (như lúc khỏe, tràn đầy năng lượng). Mình ngộ ra sự thật đầu tiên: phần lớn những thứ trong mình, của mình, lại chẳng phải là mình 😕. Với giác ngộ này, mình chuyển hướng từ thay đổi người khác, điều khiển người khác, sang thay đổi chính mình, vì cả thảy đều là "nó", và nó chẳng chịu nghe lời mình.
						- 3. Quay vào quan sát bên trong, gọi là "quán", thì mình dần kết nối lại với chính mình, thấu hiểu chính mình hơn, qua đó kéo "nó" lại gần "mình" hơn... trong chính ngôi nhà thân tâm này. Nhờ gần hơn mà mình thấy rõ nó hơn, thông cảm hơn, bớt phán xét hơn, bớt bực tức hơn, chấp nhận hơn. Và những lần tiếp xúc với người ngoài thì lại cho mình thấy là mình dễ dàng thông cảm hơn cho người khác, nên mình ngộ ra cái thứ hai: mọi người xung quanh chỉ là ảnh phản chiếu của mình, mình chấp nhận được mình thì mới chấp nhận được người khác. 
						  Tuy đã rất gần gũi, rất thấu hiểu nhưng mình thấy vẫn còn một sự ngăn cách cơ bản ở cái thấy, dù là thấy bên trong: thấy thì không làm, làm thì không thấy. Cái thấy bên trong dù đã gần gũi hơn cái thấy tách biệt bên ngoài rồi, nhưng cái đối tượng được thấy vẫn là "nó", dù nó có nghe lời mình nhưng vẫn còn sự ngăn cách.
						- 4. Qua những trải nghiệm đi qua cửa tử, mình mới ngộ ra rằng rào cản vi tế của cái thấy bên trong chính là việc mình còn chấp "cái thức này là mình!" Buông cả cái thấy bên trong, tức cái thức này ra, mình "chết", không phản ứng, không thấy, không còn gì nữa, hòa tan vào mọi thứ, không còn cái gì là mình nữa... thì nghịch lý thay là "mình" lại "thấy" rõ mọi thứ. Mà cả cái "mình" lẫn cái "thấy" này tuy giống như cũ nhưng lại rất khác... Nói chung là khó nói. Nói chung là sự chấp nhận mọi thứ, vì chấp nhận nên gọi là "mình" chứ không phải là cái "mình này" đối lập với cái "nó" hay cái "mình kia".
						  Và trải nghiệm "mình hòa tan" đó cũng rất hiếm, chỉ mới xảy ra trong những trường hợp extreme: mấy năm trước là nhờ chất thức thần và những lần kiệt sức; lần viêm phổi kỳ này là lần đầu tiên chủ động được nhưng cũng nhờ rất nhiều vào trạng thái bệnh.
					- Lần ego death thứ nhất (số 2 trên) là cái chết nhỏ, tiểu tử tiểu ngộ: lần đầu nhận ra sự thật "phần lớn mình chẳng phải là mình" thì thường bị sốc, khủng hoảng hiện sinh, hoang mang không biết mình là ai. Bản thân Định không trải qua cú sốc này trong đời này, nhưng có chứng kiến người thân bị sốc.
					- Chỉ sau cái chết đầu tiên đó hành giả mới 1 lòng vững bước trên con đường giải thoát, không còn thoái lui, tức tương đương với bậc "dự lưu", hay còn gọi là "thất lai" (còn 7 đời luân hồi nữa).
					- Qua một quãng đường dài tu tập, như số 3 trên, thì hành giả mới tới "đầu sào trăm thước", bước thêm bước nữa, té xuống, chết luôn cái thức, đại tử đại ngộ 😊 tiếp sau đó thì tui chưa biết, vì mới bắt đầu đi đoạn này...
					- Thực ra cách nói "chết" của tui... cũng chỉ là một cách nói phá chấp vào chỗ "sống" của người đời thôi, chứ đúng ra nó là "không sống không chết" 😜. Như nhà Phật nói "Nibbana (niết-bàn, nirvana) = complete death 😁" vậy. Nghĩa của niết-bàn vốn chẳng phải là một cảnh giới cao siêu như dân gian tưởng tượng mà chỉ đơn giản là sự dập tắt hoàn toàn (extinction), nên được dịch thành những từ như sau: diệt tận, tịch diệt, viên tịch, ... hay nói nôm ra cho dễ hiểu là "chết hết" 😂
				- Nãy đang ngồi thiền, đang nghĩ "may hôm nay nhờ đám giỗ cụ Hùng mà mình được thoải mái ngồi thiền, chẳng phải lo tới giờ đi làm..." thì bỗng nhớ tới bác Hiệp 😁 vụ "*chơi bao lâu thì nghỉ hay chơi suốt đời*"
				  collapsed:: true
					- Hồi đó ông @Hiep có thắc mắc "làm sao mà người ta có thể làm 1 việc có vẻ nhàm chán đó mãi được?" Với người khác thì tui không biết, nhưng với tui thì:
						- 1. Tui không thấy chán, dù cho bệnh đau cũng không thấy khó chịu hay chán ghét mà còn thấy "ngon, bổ dưỡng" nên mới ăn nó hoài. Chả có món nào "ăn không ngon" mà có thể ăn hoài được.
						- 2. Tui thường sống trong hiện tại, lúc thiền thì thấy "mình sống bằng thiền, không phải sống bằng cơm" nên không có nhu cầu hết giờ để đi ăn cơm. Lúc đạp xe thì sống bằng đạp xe chứ không phải "đạp để có sức khỏe, hay đạp để tới 1 cái đích nào đó, như tới nhà ông Hiệp", nên đạp hoài bao lâu cũng được. Các môn thể thao khác cũng vậy, xuống nước là tui làm con hải cẩu sống trong nước chứ không phải lặn để có kết quả gì đó ở trên bờ, lúc leo núi thì không phải để lên đỉnh mà là làm một thằng mọi sống trong rừng, v.v.
					- Vì thế nên tui không giỏi những thành tích của thế gian. Tui không nín thở vì số phút, không ngồi thiền vì số giờ hay 1 chỉ số level nào đó (sơ, nhị, tam, tứ thiền). Tui thấy khi mình làm cái này vì 1 cái đích khác thì mình không sống trọn vẹn trong đó... và tui không làm được. Tui phục mọi người là có thể làm vì 1 cái đích nào đó ở bên ngoài, thậm chí chỉ là những con số ... mà đối với tui là "ảo lòi"
					- Nên hint của tui là ông thử đổi chữ "chơi" thành chữ "sống" xem sao 😉. Mình nên tìm cái để mình sống, mình sống bằng cái gì, nhờ cái gì, vì cái gì, v.v.
					- Và 2 chữ đó cũng reflect 2 hoàn cảnh khác nhau:
						- Kẻ hết phước thì chỉ biết nghĩ tới sinh tồn, nên chỉ nghĩ tới "làm sao để sống", còn "chơi" thì xa xỉ quá!
						- Người phước dày thì đã đủ sống nên chỉ tìm món nào chơi cho nó đỡ chán...
					- Tóm lại, chẳng có món chơi nào có thể chơi suốt đời được đâu 😜, chỉ có sống mới sống được suốt đời... by definition 😁
				- Thực ra cũng có nhiều lúc tui nản, đó là những lúc tui bị **mất tập trung vào hiện tại**, hoặc bị quá khứ lôi kéo khiến mình tiếc nuối, hoặc bị tương lai đen tối (do mình tự tưởng tượng ra hoặc do người khác "hù") khiến mình cảm thấy "không thể vượt qua được". Dạo này tui đã có người bạn đồng hành, và những lần như vậy, tui hỏi vợ "anh thấy mù mịt quá, bất lực quá, không thể tiếp tục được", thì bả đã nhắc nhở và động viên để tui quay lại hiện tại thì mọi thứ lại ổn trở lại 😊

					- Dù đó giờ tui chưa nghĩ chuyện đua tranh với người khác bao giờ, nhưng cũng nhiều lần bị thắt cổ trong chính cái "kinh nghiệm quá khứ" của mình. Xin share một sự chuyển hoá kỳ diệu ở [chuyến đầu đạp xe đi xa lúc mới về VN (2009)](https://creatzynotes.blogspot.com/2009/06/khai-truong-chien-ma-du-ngoan-can-tho.html)
					- Lúc về VN (2009), mình đã chọn đi xe đạp để được thoả thích vùng vẫy, như cá về với nước, như chim về với trời (mình ghét cảm giác bị bó gối trong/trên những chiếc xe cơ giới).
					  Lúc đó còn thanh niên sung sức, năng lượng tràn trề, nên mới có kinh nghiệm thú vị này: Số là chạy trong TP thì mình thấy đạp ở tốc độ 30km/h là chuyện bình thường... mà không biết rằng đó chỉ là hưởng sái luồng gió của xe máy và xe hơi trong TP mà thôi. Thế là vô tình mình bị chấp vào con số 30km/h đó mà không biết. Tháng 5 năm đó, mình quyết định khai trương một chuyến đi xa bằng cung SG - Cần Thơ về thăm mẹ. Cung đường 200km mà mới đạp tới Bến Lức là đã chết thẳng cẳng, vào quán võng ngủ 1 giấc, hồi sức đạp tới Tân An lại chết lần 2 sâu hơn, ngay giữa đường luôn, ko kịp tìm tới quán võng luôn...
					- Lúc đó mình thấy hụt hơi, thở không nổi, toàn thân lạnh toát... cứ tưởng là do "thiếu oxy", ai ngờ sau này học freedive mới biết là do thiếu CO$_2$ (thở gấp) chứ ko phải thiếu oxy.
					- Tới Tân An là mới được 60km, nên coi như chuyến này thất bại rồi... sau khi ngồi ở lề đường hồi sức một chút chỉ đủ để lết tới quán võng gần nhứt, kêu ly nước chưa kịp uống là đã chết lịm tới chiều sập tối mới mở mắt dậy.
					- Lúc dậy, mình quán lại thì thấy mình đã bị chấp vào tốc độ ở trong TP (quá khứ) mà quên mất hiện tại là một thực tế hoàn toàn khác. Ngộ ra cái đồng hồ tốc độ đã "đánh lừa" mình khiến mình chết giấc 2 lần, nên lần này leo lên xe, mình dẹp quách mấy con số đó qua một bên, chỉ tập trung vào hơi thở và chân đạp. Cảm nhận hơi thở, cảm nhận lực đạp ở chân, chỉ khoảng 10-15 phút thì mình đã sync được chúng lại với nhau, hơi thở nhịp nhàng với nhịp đạp, vào ra vào ra, lên xuống lên xuống nhịp nhàng... một cảm giác hoàn toàn khác... Mình bỗng thấy "ồ cứ như vầy thì mình đạp tới mai cũng được, chả bao giờ mệt cả!" Thế là mình tiếp tục thẳng tiến về Cần Thơ, cũng chẳng còn care là còn bao nhiêu cây số nữa, mọi con số từ tốc độ đến cự ly giờ đây đều vô nghĩa, thậm chí độc hại với mình.
					- Thế là từ đó về sau cứ đạp đến khi nào mệt thì nghỉ chứ cũng chẳng theo kế hoạch cũ là 30km hay 60km gì nữa. Còn tốc độ thì lên xuống tuỳ duyên, chẳng còn làm mình vướng mắt nữa.
					- Và quả thực như mình đã cảm thấy lúc bắt được nhịp đạp & thở, suốt từ Tân An về Cần Thơ mình đã chạy một cách thoải mái "như không", hoàn toàn đối lập với 2 lần chết giấc lúc mới ra khỏi SG.
					- Dù cái nghiệp quá khứ này của tui (kinh nghiệm "30km/h là thường") chỉ mới tích tụ có vài tháng trước đó thôi, mà nó cũng đủ thắt cổ tui chết ngất 2 lần, lần 2 tưởng xỉu giữa đường rồi... may là lết được tới quán võng.
					- Nên tui thấy là mình ko có nô lệ cho ai khác hay cái gì khác ngoài chính "nghiệp tích tụ trong quá khứ" của mình mà thôi.
					- Buông quá khứ xuống, hiện tại hiện ra thật tuyệt vời!

					- Còn [chuyện của Vance Vanders](https://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2015/08/10/a-near-death-from-voodoo-hexing/) thì là về "giả dược" (placebo effect), là cái mà hồi đó ông hỏi "có phải đây là giả dược không" đó. Vì Tây y chấp vào vật chất nên coi các tâm dược là "giả dược", chứ thế giới cổ đại đã dùng tâm dược từ lâu, như thần chú, bùa chú, voodoo, và thế giới hiện đại cũng có các kỹ thuật như thôi miên, sugar pills, và cả phẫu thuật giả.
						- Vance Vanders bị ông thầy cúng dùng thuật voodoo để nguyền rủa cho chết đi, và ông ta đã bị suy nhược cơ thể đến sắp chết.
						- Khi vợ Vance Vanders đưa ổng vào bệnh viện tây y thì bác sỹ mới tìm cách dùng giả dược để "giải bùa" voodoo của ông thầy cúng kia. BS đã chích thuốc ói để cho ổng ói ra và lén thả con tắc kè xanh vào bồn ói rồi la toáng lên "Vance nhìn nè, ông đã ói con tắc kè đang ăn ruột ông ra rồi, ông đã được giải bùa rồi!" Vance nhìn con tắc kè mà sợ phát khiếp, rồi ngất đi trong 12h sau đó. Khi tỉnh dậy thì ông ta đã hết tâm bệnh và 1 tuần sau thì cơ thể ổng đã bình phục.

				  là đau
				  mất niềm tin vào những người mà mình tin nhất trong suốt bao nhiêu lâu
				  cảm thấy k sống nổi nữa, k muốn sống nữa
				- và bây giờ thì em cảm thấy như chồng đang mất niềm tin vào mình, mà em có xác nhận điều đó từ chồng ko, có chắc là chồng đau vì điều đó ko hay đau vì cái khác?
				- Lan:
				  ảnh chưa mất niềm tin vào em, ảnh chỉ mới cảm thấy sao dạo này em xa cách, ảnh cảm thấy sao ảnh đã thay đổi bớt ác với em rất nhiều, yêu thương em hơn, nhưng trách rằng em đang đòi tự do của em nhiều quá
				- Vậy đầu tiên là mình tự gợi lại nỗi đau của mình và nó khác với nỗi đau hiện tại của chồng hen.
				  Thực ra mình chả biết người ta đau cái gì đâu, mà chỉ có thể "suy bụng ta ra bụng người" thôi.
				- Perspectivistic: cùng lắm thì đó là những gì mình biết về người ta, ko thể nói hoành toàn chính xác là người ta như vậy.
				  Mỗi người là một thực thể đa chiều, rất phức tạp, chỉ thể hiện ra 1 mặt nào đó trong 1 hoàn cảnh cụ thể. Và "đi với phật mặc áo cà sa, đi với ma mặc áo giấy", sự "đồng thanh tương ứng" khiến họ thể hiện ra mặt này tương ứng với người đối diện, chứ đó ko phải là tất cả.
				- Perspectivism, em có chấp nhận được ko. Chấp nhận về ý thức thôi, chứ về cảm xúc thì chỉ khi tự mình nếm trải mới cảm được, anh ko đòi hỏi nó bây giờ. Chỉ hỏi là về mặt ý thức, thì em có thể "thấy" ra được là những gì mình biết về chồng chỉ là một phần của chồng ko?
				- Lan:
				  dạ có, chấp nhận
				- Vậy bây giờ để diễn ra tiếp, bây giờ là tưởng tượng nhé... xin lỗi là đưa ra một ví dụ tiêu cực, chỉ là giả dụ thôi, ko nói là chồng hiện tại của em sẽ như vậy nhé.... nào đã sẵn sàng cho một chuyến roller coaster chưa?

			  collapsed:: true
				- Hãy tưởng tượng một nhánh thời gian rẽ ra một cõi "trong mơ" để ko bị lẫn lộn với thực tế tương lai ở ngoài đời sau này.
				  Trong một cõi mơ, em có "tha tâm thông", là thần thông thấu biết tâm người, nên biết nỗi đau của chồng mình là gì, thấy nó có 3 phần giống của mình, tức phần "mất niềm tin", nhưng 7 phần còn lại là khác, VD "bị chê trách".
				- Ở đó, em bay lên từ trên cao nhìn xuống, thấy cái duyên mình gặp chồng đã khiến trong suốt quá trình đó ảnh chỉ thể hiện ra 3 phần và giấu lại 7 phần... mà con người phàm tục của mình "dưới kia" ko hề hay biết.
				- Rồi em lại có "thiên nhãn thông", là thần thông thấy biết xuyên không thời gian....
				- Với cái tâm tự do bay trên không, ko bị lớp áo da che mắt, em nhìn xuống xuyên qua không gian, thấy suốt ruột gan.... à mà thôi, toàn những thứ hôi thối xấu xa..., nên em quay đi, nhìn xuyên thời gian...
				- Nhìn xuyên thời gian, tới tương lai, em thấy con người trần tục "dưới kia" cứ cuốn vòng vòng với nỗi đau trong quá khứ về việc mất niềm tin của mình mà cố gắng tạo niềm tin...
				- vì cũng được thoả mãn 3 phần nên anh chồng vẫn có phần nhẹ bớt, nhưng chẳng bao giờ là hết hẳn, vì 7 phần còn lại lớn hơn gấp đôi lận...
				- và rồi một ngày nào đó... khi con người trần tục của em lẫn của chồng đều đã chịu hết nổi, bên em thì nhường nhịn hết nổi, bên chồng thì quá bất mãn vì ảnh cũng đã tưởng là gặp em sẽ giải quyết được 100% nỗi đau mà rốt cuộc lúc nào cũng còn đau 70-80%...
				- Thì đổ bể ra... ảnh lật 7 phần còn lại ra vì nó đã bị dồn nén quá lâu, nó thể hiện ra là một người rất khác với "người chồng" mà em đã từng quen thuộc, phủ nhận cả những điều hay ho nhứt, những lý tưởng cao đẹp mà ảnh đã share với em bấy lâu nay, và vô tình "phủi bỏ" hết công sức của em. 😢
				- Bị phủ nhận sạch trơn, con người trần tục của em lại một lần nữa mất hoàn toàn niềm tin, đau đớn khôn tả xiết!
				- Vì quá đau đớn, con người trần tục của em ko thể chấp nhận 7 phần còn lại của ảnh là thật, là cũng đau đớn ko kém mình, mà chỉ thấy là ảnh đã lừa dối mình bấy lâu.
				- Chìm đắm trong tuyệt vọng, đau khổ, em rút vào trong, chẳng thể mở lòng để có thể thấu hiểu được ai khác...
				- nhưng do con người trần tục đó ko có khả năng thấy rõ chính mình, nên theo bản năng thì nó cứ vô tình tìm tới một người "đồng cảnh ngộ" khác, dù cho ý thức vẫn cứ bảo "chỉ có mình mới giải quyết được thôi"
				- và cứ như thế mà nỗi đau cũ cứ cuốn mình vào vòng xoáy mới với ảo tưởng mới.... cứ hi vọng rồi sụp đổ, tin thật nhiều rồi nghi thật nhiều
				- Một ngày nào đó, cái thân người dưới kia chịu hết nổi, chết ngất, thoát xác, bay lên nhìn lại tất cả... thì mới ngộ là "ồ, nó là vậy đó!"
				- Xong giấc mơ, em có theo dõi kịp ko?

				- Khi "buồn ngủ mà gặp chiếu manh" thì chiếc chiếu dù rách nát vẫn còn hơn chăn nhung nệm gấm. Khi những tâm hồn đau khổ gặp nhau, dù chỉ 10% tương đồng là đã dữ lắm rồi, nên ban đầu luôn quay cái 10% đó vào nhau để thấy 100% là "đồng điệu", để hi vọng là mình đã gặp được duyên để giải quyết 100% đau khổ của mình.
				- Chỉ tới khi hết buồn ngủ, tỉnh dậy thì chiếc chiếu manh mới hiện nguyên hình...
				  *Thằng cùi mà lấy con đui
				  Đến khi sáng mắt, con đui bỏ chồng!*
				- Lan:
				  em nghĩ là nó k phải là tưởng tượng luôn vì nó đã xảy ra đúng như vậy đó anh. và đã xảy ra cách đây rất lâu rồi. do vậy em cũng không còn kì vọng rằng ảnh sẽ không bao giờ phủi bỏ mình. em đã chuẩn bị tư thế sẵn sàng để nếu ảnh có bỏ, thì cũng k là điều gì đáng ngạc nhiên
				- Thực ra tương lai chỉ là sự lặp lại của quá khứ... trong một vòng xoay vô tận. Nên nói là "tưởng tượng tương lai" thực ra chỉ là diễn lại quá khứ với một ngôn ngữ khác mà thôi.
				- Chỉ khi nào mình buông hết mọi thứ ra, để mình "bay lên", để nhìn xuống toàn bộ vòng tròn đó... mình mới thấy là... thực ra mình đã xoay vòng ko chỉ 1 mà nhiều nhiều vòng như vậy rồi... c

						- (Phần thêm cuối) Cảnh sát yêu cầu dừng cuộc bộ hành
							- BBC Sinhala đã đặt câu hỏi với Phó Tổng Thanh tra Cảnh sát Buddhika Manathunga, người phát ngôn truyền thông cảnh sát, về tình hình liên quan đến chuyến thăm Sri Lanka của thầy Thích Minh Tuệ.
							- Người phát ngôn cho biết khoảng 40 người đã tham gia cuộc bộ hành này theo hình thức một đoàn diễu hành.
							  Ông giải thích rằng bộ hành được xem là một hoạt động thuộc loại diễu hành.
							- “Việc tổ chức diễu hành cần có giấy phép từ cảnh sát. Thứ hai, theo luật nhập cư, những người đến Sri Lanka bằng visa du lịch không được phép tham gia biểu tình.”
							- “Dựa trên tất cả những yếu tố này, chúng tôi đã thông báo với họ rằng hoạt động này là bất hợp pháp và cần được thực hiện sau khi có giấy phép. Vì vậy, họ đã dừng hoạt động này tại khu vực Kuliyapitiya. Hiện tại, họ đang lưu trú tại một ngôi chùa.”
							- Người phát ngôn cảnh sát nói thêm: “Nếu trong tương lai họ tiếp tục thực hiện hoạt động này mà không có giấy phép hợp lệ, đó sẽ là hành vi bất hợp pháp. Chúng tôi chắc chắn sẽ hành động theo luật hiện hành. Hiện tại, chưa có ai bị bắt giữ. Chúng tôi đang tiến hành điều tra để làm rõ các tình tiết.”
							- “Lần đầu tiên, chúng tôi đã thông báo yêu cầu họ dừng hoạt động này, và họ đã tuân thủ, dừng ngay tại thời điểm đó. Tuy nhiên, nếu họ tiếp tục thực hiện, chúng tôi chắc chắn sẽ áp dụng các biện pháp pháp lý.”
							- Người phát ngôn cho biết nhóm người Việt Nam này hiện đang lưu trú tại một tu viện rừng (aranya senasana) ở khu vực Warakapola.

							- thầy Thích Minh Tuệ gây tranh cãi vì bị Giáo hội Phật giáo Việt Nam, tổ chức Phật giáo duy nhất được chính phủ Việt Nam công nhận, bác bỏ tư cách tu sĩ. Giáo hội này đã gắn nhãn thầy Thích Minh Tuệ là “tu sĩ giả”.
							- Theo điều tra của BBC Sinhala, Giáo hội Phật giáo Việt Nam đã gửi thư đến Bộ Phật giáo và Tôn giáo Sri Lanka, yêu cầu không công nhận thầy Thích Minh Tuệ tại nước này.

							- Tổng Ủy viên Ban Phật giáo R.M.P. Ratnayake nói với BBC Sinhala rằng nhóm này đã đến Sri Lanka bằng visa du lịch. Ông nói: “Họ có thể đến như vậy, họ có hộ chiếu và đã được cấp visa.”
							- Tuy nhiên, Thượng toạ Pelane Dhamma Kusala, trụ trì chùa ở Berlin, Đức, cho biết ông đã cảnh báo chính quyền Sri Lanka về nhóm này trước khi họ đến, nhưng không có hành động kịp thời nào được thực hiện.
							- Ông nói: “Họ đã đến đây rồi, ngay ngày họ đến tôi đã báo cho Ủy viên Phật giáo, rằng đất nước chúng ta không có quy định như vậy. Nhưng họ chẳng làm gì cả. Bất cứ ai cũng có thể đến đây và làm bất cứ điều gì.”
							- “Nhóm này đang diễn kịch. Họ đi ngược lại Giáo hội Phật giáo ở Việt Nam, thể hiện quan điểm đối lập và khiến người ta cảm thấy họ như những vị Phật. Có cả một nhóm cư sĩ đi cùng họ. Họ dùng YouTube để tuyên truyền, ở nhiều nơi trên thế giới có người Việt Nam sinh sống. Họ quyên góp tiền từ những người này. Đó là một tổ chức lớn.”
							- “Nhóm đó thực hiện việc đi bộ. Họ đến các ngôi chùa và cho thế giới thấy người dân Sri Lanka kính trọng họ. Sri Lanka là một quốc gia Phật giáo, và họ muốn thể hiện rằng đất nước Phật giáo này công nhận họ. Điều này khiến chính phủ Việt Nam và các tu sĩ ở đó khó chịu, vì những người bị họ bác bỏ lại được chúng ta công nhận.” Thượng tọa Pelane Dhamma Kusala Thero đã nói với BBC Sinhala như thế.

							- Tuy nhiên, Giáo hội Phật giáo Việt Nam (VBS) nhấn mạnh rằng không công nhận thầy Thích Minh Tuệ là tu sĩ Phật giáo. Giáo hội này là tổ chức Phật giáo duy nhất được chính phủ Việt Nam công nhận.
							- Thực tế, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ không tuyên bố mình là tu sĩ hay liên kết với bất kỳ ngôi chùa hoặc tổ chức nào thuộc Giáo hội Phật giáo Việt Nam.
							- Thay vào đó, thầy tự nhận mình là “một người cố gắng thực hành theo lời dạy của Đức Phật”.
							- Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ đã trở thành một nhân vật nổi tiếng trên mạng xã hội, và mọi nơi thầy đến đều được các nhà hoạt động đưa tin rộng rãi qua mạng xã hội.
							- Việc đi bộ bằng chân trần, sống bằng khất thực, tìm nơi trú ẩn trong rừng, lùm cây hoặc nghĩa trang, và từ bỏ mọi gắn bó với vật chất đã khiến thầy Thích Minh Tuệ nhanh chóng trở nên nổi tiếng khắp Việt Nam.

						- තික් මින් තියු හිමි මීට පෙර බොහෝ දෙනෙකු අවධානයට ලක් වූයේ වියට්නාමය කළඹමින් රටපුරා පාද චාරිකාවේ නිරත වීමෙන් අනතුරුවය. සාම්ප්‍රදායික දාන පාත්‍රය වෙනුවට උන්වහන්සේ රැගෙන ගියේ 'රයිස් කුකරයක්' (rice cooker) වන අතර එය බොහෝ දෙනෙකුගේ කුතුහලයට මෙන් ම ප්‍රසාදයට බඳුන් වීමට ද හේතු විය.
						- බොහෝ බෞද්ධ අනුගාමිකයින් අතර උන්වහන්සේ ප්‍රසිද්ධ මාතෘකාවක් බවට පත්වූයේ මන්දැයි මිනිසුන් නොදන්නා තරම් ය. තෙළෙස් ධූතාංග කෙරෙහි වූ අචල කැපවීම නිසා ත් පැවිදි චර්යාවේ ඇති විශේෂ බව නිසා ත් උන්වහන්සේගේ ක්‍රියාකලාපය සුවිශේෂී සංසිද්ධියක් බවට පත්ව ඇත. පාවහන් නොමැතිව ඇවිදීම, පිණ්ඩපාතයෙන් ජීවත් වීම, වනාන්තරවල, ලඳු කැළෑවල හෝ සුසාන භූමිවල සෙවණක් සෙවීම සහ සියලු භෞතික දෑ කෙරෙහි ඇති ඇලීම අත්හැරීම මෙයට ඇතුළත් ය.
						- තික් මින් තියු හිමියන් සහ අප අතර සංවාදය සිදු වූයේ, තායිලන්තයේ උබොන් රචතනී ප්‍රදේශයේ 217 අධිවේගී මාර්ගයට යාබද උද්‍යානයක දහවල් දානය සඳහා නතර වූ අවස්ථාවේදී ය.
						- සම්මුඛ සාකච්ඡාවේදී, මින් තියු හිමියන් සිය ප්‍රතිපත්තිය පිළිබඳ උන්වහන්සේගේ අදහස් මෙන් ම වසර ගණනාවක් කළ පාද යාත්‍රාව පිළිබඳ උන්වහන්සේගේ හැඟීම් සහ අත්දැකීම් බෙදාහදා ගත්හ.
						- බීබීසී: හාමුදුරුවනේ, ලාඕසයේ සහ තායිලන්තයේ පාද යාත්‍රාවේ නිරත වීම වියට්නාමයේ පාද යාත්‍රාවේ නිරත වීමට සමාන හා වෙනස් වන්නේ කෙසේ ද?
						- මින් තියු හිමි: ලාඕසයේ සහ තායිලන්තයේ දේශගුණය වියට්නාමයේ දේශගුණයට වඩා වෙනස්. එහේ දේශගුණය තරමක් සීතලයි. පොදුවේ ගත්තා ම පාරවල්, වනාන්තර ආදියේ බොහෝ වෙනස්කම් තියෙනවා. මිනිසුන් සහ සිරිත් විරිත් පවා වෙනස්.
						- තවත් වෙනස්කමක් තමයි වියට්නාමයේ සංචාරය කරවාට වඩා ලාඕසයේ සහ තායිලන්තයේ සංචාරය කරද්දී හම්බ වෙන්නේ බෞද්ධයන් අඩු ගණනක්.
						- වියට්නාමයේ ක්වන් චී සහ හියු ප්‍රදේශවල ගත කළ කාලයේ සෙනග වැඩියි. ඒකෙන් වාහන තදබදයක් ඇති වෙනවා. මේ පැත්තේ [ලාඕසය සහ තායිලන්තය], යද්දී වාහන තදබදයක් නැහැ. හැමදේ ම හොඳයි. ස්ථාවරයි.
						- දුෂ්කර පාරවල් සහ මහන්සිය කොහේ ගත්තත්, සංචාරය කළත් එකයි. හැම තැනකදී ම නොපසුබට උත්සහය අවශ්‍යයි.
						- කන බොන එක කොහෙත් එක හා සමානයි. සමහර වෙලාවට බඩගිනි උණත් සීලය රැකගන්න වෙනවා. දවසකට එක දානේ වේලක් අරගෙන. තාර දාපු පාරක වමෙන් ගමන් කළත් දකුණෙන් ගමන් කළත් වෙනසක් නැහැ.

						- මින් තියු හිමි: නැහැ. අපි වඩින්නේ පාර අයිනෙන්. නීති රෙගුලාසිවලට අනුව.
						- ජීවිතය සහ මරණය ගැන ඔබට වද වෙන්න බැහැ.
						- මම සෞඛ්‍යය ගැන සග මරණය තැකීමක් කරන්නේ නැහැ. මම මැරේවි. ඒකෙ ගැටලුවක් නැහැ. වාහන තියෙන නිසා මම වඩින්නේ පාරේ දකුණු පැත්තෙන්.
						- ඒ අය වාහනවලින් යද්දී, මම බය වෙනවා නම්, මම තවදුරටත් මේ ගමන යන්නේ නැහැ, මම මගේ ගමන නවත්තනවා.

						- තනිව ගියත් තවත් පිරිසක් එක්ක ගියත් වැදගත් දේ ඔබේ මනස. මම මෙතන අනිත් හාමුදුරුවරු එක්ක හිඳගෙන, මිනිස්සු හම්බ වුණාට මගේ මනස සන්සුන්. වෙන කෙනෙක් හිටියේ නැතත් මට දැන්නෙන්නේ ඒකමයි.
						- ඔබේ මනස නොනවත්වා වැඩ කරනවා කියන්නේ, ඒක නිකම් සෙනඟ ගොඩක් ඉන්න තැනක් වගේ. මොකද, ඔබ එක තැනක වාඩි වෙලා හිටියත්, තනිව ඇවිද ගියත්, ඔබ හැම වෙලේ ම අනිත් අය ගැන හිතන නිසා.

						- මම දකින වෙනස තමයි ඉස්සර මට ගොඩක් දේවල් අරගෙන යන්න වුණා. ඒත් දැන් මේ තුන්පට සිවුරයි, පාත්තරයයි ඇරෙන්න මට වෙන දෙයක් නැහැ.

						  Chú thích: Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ nghỉ ngơi tại một công viên gần đường số 217 ở tỉnh Ubon Ratchathani
						- Ngày đăng: 13/01/2025
						- Cuộc bộ hành của thầy Thích Minh Tuệ, người đang đi bộ khất thực đến vùng đất nơi Đức Phật đản sinh, đang thu hút sự chú ý của nhiều người. Trong lúc thầy cùng đoàn chư tăng đi bộ qua vùng đông bắc Thái Lan, BBC News Việt Nam đã có cơ hội trò chuyện với thầy.
						- Trước đây, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ từng gây chú ý khi thực hiện cuộc bộ hành khắp Việt Nam, làm xôn xao dư luận. Thay vì dùng bát truyền thống, thầy mang theo một **nồi cơm điện**, điều này không chỉ gây tò mò mà còn khiến nhiều người ngưỡng mộ.
						- Lý do thầy trở thành chủ đề nổi bật trong cộng đồng Phật tử gần như không cần giải thích. Sự kiên định với **13 hạnh đầu đà**, cùng lối sống tu hành đặc biệt, đã biến hành động của thầy thành một hiện tượng độc đáo. Điều này bao gồm việc đi bộ chân trần, sống bằng khất thực, tìm nơi trú ẩn trong rừng sâu, nghĩa trang, hoặc dưới bóng cây, và từ bỏ mọi luyến ái với vật chất.
						- Cuộc đối thoại giữa chúng tôi và thầy Thích Minh Tuệ diễn ra tại một công viên gần đường cao tốc 217 ở tỉnh Ubon Ratchathani, Thái Lan, khi thầy dừng chân để nhận bữa trưa.
						- Trong buổi phỏng vấn, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ đã chia sẻ quan điểm về lối sống tu hành, cảm xúc, và trải nghiệm từ nhiều năm bộ hành.
						- **BBC**: Thưa thầy, việc bộ hành ở Lào và Thái Lan giống và khác với bộ hành ở Việt Nam như thế nào?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**:
							- Khí hậu ở Lào và Thái Lan khác với Việt Nam, có phần lạnh hơn. Đường sá, rừng rậm, và nhiều thứ khác cũng khác. Con người và phong tục cũng không giống nhau.
							- Một điểm khác nữa là ở Lào và Thái Lan, tôi gặp ít Phật tử hơn so với khi bộ hành ở Việt Nam. Ở Việt Nam, đặc biệt tại Quảng Trị và Huế, đông người theo dõi, gây ra tắc nghẽn giao thông. Ở đây [Lào và Thái Lan], không có tình trạng kẹt xe, mọi thứ đều tốt và ổn định.
							- Dù đường sá khó khăn hay mệt mỏi, ở đâu cũng vậy, bộ hành đòi hỏi sự kiên trì không ngừng.
							- Chuyện ăn uống thì ở đâu cũng giống nhau. Có lúc đói, nhưng vẫn phải giữ giới. Mỗi ngày chỉ nhận một bữa ăn. Dù đi bên trái hay bên phải con đường nhựa, cũng không có gì khác biệt.

						- **BBC**: Trên đường, xe cộ lớn chạy nhanh qua lại. Khi bộ hành như vậy, thầy có cảm thấy lo lắng về an toàn không?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Không. Chúng tôi đi bộ ở lề đường, tuân theo luật lệ.
							- Không thể lo lắng về sự sống và cái chết.
							- Tôi không bận tâm đến sức khỏe hay cái chết. Nếu tôi chết, cũng không có vấn đề gì. Vì có xe cộ, tôi đi bên phải đường.
							- Nếu tôi sợ hãi khi họ lái xe qua, tôi sẽ không tiếp tục cuộc hành trình này nữa, tôi sẽ dừng lại.
						- **BBC**: Thầy có thể chia sẻ sự khác biệt giữa việc bộ hành một mình và bộ hành cùng các vị sư khác không?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Có, có sự khác biệt.
							- Ví dụ, bộ hành một mình dễ dàng và tự do hơn. Nhưng khi đi cùng một nhóm, nhiều thứ thay đổi, như phải tìm nơi nghỉ ngơi đủ rộng cho cả đoàn.
							- Khi đi một mình, tôi có thể dừng ở bất cứ đâu, rất tự do. Nhưng giờ đây, khi đi cùng người khác, có người giúp tôi, báo trước các việc cần làm.
							- Ví dụ, có anh Bảo, anh Sếp, và hôm nay có anh Sơn đi cùng. Họ thông báo cho tôi về nơi nghỉ, liên lạc với chính quyền. Họ báo trước khi đến mỗi nơi. Tôi cảm thấy mọi thứ diễn ra tốt đẹp và điều đó mang lại niềm vui.
							- Dù đi một mình hay cùng người khác, điều quan trọng là tâm trí. Tôi ngồi đây với các vị sư, gặp gỡ mọi người, nhưng tâm tôi vẫn tĩnh lặng. Dù không có ai, tôi vẫn cảm thấy như vậy.
							- Tâm trí không ngừng hoạt động giống như một nơi đông đúc. Dù bạn ngồi một chỗ hay đi bộ một mình, bạn luôn nghĩ về người khác.
							- Nếu không, bạn sẽ sinh lòng tham ái với người này, hoặc sân hận với người kia, hoặc những suy nghĩ tiêu cực và dục vọng thế tục. Khi tâm khởi những điều đó, chẳng khác gì ở giữa đám đông.
							- Khi tôi ở đây, nếu tôi không sân hận hay bực tức vì sự hiện diện của người khác, tôi xem mình như đang ở một mình. Đó chính là sự khác biệt.
							- Nói chung, việc một nơi đông đúc hay không phụ thuộc vào tâm trí bạn. Bạn có thể ở giữa khu chợ đông người, nhưng nếu không tương tác với họ, nơi đó như không có ai. Bạn ở một mình. Nhưng nếu tâm bạn rối loạn hay bị phân tán, thì nơi đó trở nên đông đúc.

						- **BBC**: Theo lối sống tu hành của thầy, một ngày diễn ra như thế nào?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Ban đêm, chúng tôi nghỉ ngơi.
							- Thông thường, chúng tôi đi bộ từ 6 giờ sáng đến 7 giờ tối. Nếu chưa hoàn thành chặng đường, chúng tôi đi thêm một chút rồi nghỉ.
							- Khi mặt trời mọc, hoặc khi đường không còn ồn ào, chúng tôi đi khất thực. Thường thì những việc này không có giờ cố định.
							- Điều quan trọng là ở đúng nơi vào đúng thời điểm. Ví dụ, khi đến một nơi, nếu mọi người nói họ mệt hoặc đã quá trưa, chúng tôi nghỉ. Tôi không nói mình chỉ đi một quãng ngắn mà nghỉ, nhưng tôi nghỉ khi cần. Giờ tôi phải tiếp tục đi xa hơn.
							- Nói chung, dù là làm việc, nghỉ ngơi, hay ăn uống, quan trọng là ở đúng nơi vào đúng lúc.
							- Có lúc đi bộ mệt, tôi ngủ sớm và dậy sớm. Không phải lúc nào cũng ngủ lúc 10 giờ và dậy lúc 2 giờ. Đôi khi sớm hoặc muộn hơn 5-10 phút, gần đúng là được. Không cần tuân theo lịch trình nghiêm ngặt.
							- Nói chung, mọi thứ phụ thuộc vào duyên.
							- Việc đi trên đường và nghỉ ngơi cũng tương đối. Điều quan trọng là nghỉ đúng lúc trong hành trình. Không có luật bắt phải đi vào buổi trưa, mọi thứ tùy thuộc vào hoàn cảnh. Nhưng cũng không có luật bắt phải đi mỗi ngày.
						- **BBC**: Trong lúc bộ hành, thầy suy nghĩ hay thiền quán về điều gì?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Khi đi bộ, tôi suy nghĩ.
							- Tôi mong rằng nếu tôi và người khác muốn đi bộ, chúng tôi có thể đi. Tôi mong mọi người hạnh phúc, khỏe mạnh, và đạt được điều họ cần. Khi bộ hành, tôi mong cầu hòa bình và niềm vui.
							- Tôi mong mọi người có thể đến các nước khác mà không gặp trở ngại. Chúng tôi có thể sống hạnh phúc, tự do, thoải mái, không làm hại đất nước đó.
							- Nói chung, tôi có giới hạnh, đạo đức, và trí tuệ để không làm hại ai. Tôi không hành động gây hại. Tôi không có tham vọng kinh tế, chính trị, hay chiến tranh. Tôi bộ hành để tìm sự an lạc và hòa bình.
							- Tôi mong đi lại mà không gây hại hay nguy hiểm cho ai. Tôi tin rằng mọi người đều có thể làm được điều đó, đi lại thoải mái mà không gặp trở ngại.
							- Như một con nai trong rừng, có thể đi lại, nằm nghỉ, hay ngồi tùy ý. Không bị giam cầm, không lo âu, không bị trộm cắp, không có hành vi sai trái. Đó là điều tôi mong đợi.
						- **BBC**: Trong thời gian sống theo lối tu hành này, có câu chuyện nào khiến thầy xúc động hoặc bài học quý giá nào thầy muốn chia sẻ không?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Có,
							- đây không phải suy tư sâu sắc hay gì đặc biệt, nhưng tôi thấy, ví dụ, anh Bảo và anh Lâm giờ có thể giữ năm giới, không sát sinh, không trộm cắp, không tà dâm, không nói dối, không uống rượu, luôn yêu thương mọi người, và sống mà không gây phiền hà cho người khác như trước đây.
							- Tôi vui vì sự thay đổi đó. Nếu mọi người cũng làm được như vậy, tôi thấy đó là điều tốt đẹp.
						- **BBC**: Sau thời gian sống theo lối tu hành này, thầy thấy mình thay đổi thế nào?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Tôi thấy mình thay đổi, khác so với lối sống thế tục.
							- Tôi cũng nói với mọi người rằng tôi không phải thầy, không phải tăng sĩ, cũng không thuộc giáo hội hay tổ chức nào. Tôi là một người bình thường. Trước đây, tôi học giáo pháp của Đức Phật và thực hành theo đó.
							- Sự thay đổi tôi thấy là trước đây tôi phải mang theo nhiều thứ. Nhưng giờ, ngoài ba y và bình bát, tôi không có gì khác.

						  Chú thích: Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ đi khất thực vào sáng sớm ngày 5 tháng 1
						- **BBC**: Nhìn lại vài năm trước, tại sao thầy quyết định theo lối tu hành này?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Khi đọc giáo pháp, tôi thấy không ai vĩ đại như Đức Phật. Ngài dạy những điều tốt đẹp nhất. Nếu có ai giỏi hơn, tôi sẽ theo người đó. Nhưng tôi chưa gặp ai như vậy. Vì thế, tôi quyết định học những điều tốt đẹp, đi theo con đường Đức Phật chỉ dạy, và sống hạnh phúc theo lời Ngài. Tôi hướng đến hạnh phúc, giải thoát, và trí tuệ.
						- **BBC**: Khi quyết định xuất gia, thầy có thông báo với gia đình không? Họ phản ứng thế nào?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Trước khi xuất gia, tôi thực hành giáo pháp của Đức Phật trong sáu tháng. Sau đó, tôi xin phép gia đình. Tôi chỉ xuất gia nếu cha mẹ đồng ý. Họ đã đồng ý.
							- Giờ tôi là một tăng sĩ, tôi không còn xem họ là cha mẹ theo cách cũ. Tôi muốn học sự bình đẳng. Mọi người đều là cha mẹ tôi.
							- Dù các bạn ngồi đây, tôi xem các bạn như anh em, họ hàng. Tôi không còn khái niệm về cha mẹ hay không cha mẹ. Tôi cầu mong mọi người hạnh phúc, an lạc. Tôi là một người học giáo pháp của Đức Phật.
						- **BBC**: Ban đêm ở Thái Lan khá lạnh. Thầy làm thế nào để chịu đựng cái lạnh vào ban đêm?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Ban đêm, tôi tìm nơi kín gió để nghỉ. Với y áo cũng vậy. Tôi lấy ba y, xếp lại, khâu thành lớp dày để giữ ấm, tự làm áo bảo vệ mình. Sống với ba y và một bình bát, bạn phải rèn luyện sự chịu đựng.
							- Có lúc tôi nghĩ mình không chịu nổi, nên tôi dùng tấm vải lều để chắn gió. Nói chung, nếu bạn chưa được rèn luyện đủ, thiếu quyết tâm, hoặc không chịu nổi, bạn có thể tập dần dần để thích nghi. Đó là mong muốn, nhưng không ai nói tôi phải chịu được lạnh. Mọi thứ đến từ rèn luyện. Rèn luyện chắc chắn sẽ giúp bạn vượt qua.
						- (Image 5: Thich Minh Tue answering questions)
						  Chú thích: Cuộc bộ hành của thầy Thích Minh Tuệ đã truyền cảm hứng tích cực cho hàng triệu người
						- **BBC**: Trong một bài viết, thầy nói muốn đi bộ đến Ấn Độ, chỉ cần một người hỗ trợ thủ tục giấy tờ, và thầy có thể tự mình đi. Giờ có các vị sư khác, cùng anh Đỗ Văn Bảo, anh Lê Khả Sếp hỗ trợ, và có xe chở đồ. Sự hỗ trợ này có ảnh hưởng đến tinh thần ban đầu và sự thuần khiết của lối tu hành của thầy không?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Có và không. Những chiếc xe đó hỗ trợ cho những người đi cùng.
							- Tôi không cần mang gì. Tôi có thể tự mang đồ của mình, thức ăn, y áo. Xe là để hỗ trợ những người đi cùng tôi.
							- Vì họ cần giữ ấm, cần giường treo, chăn đệm. Họ có xe. Nếu không đi bộ được, họ dùng xe để làm giấy tờ, liên lạc với chính quyền địa phương. Việc hỗ trợ đó là điều tốt.
							- Theo tôi, trở ngại là khi người ngoài thấy xe và nói: “Anh đi bộ, nhưng có đoàn xe chở đồ theo sau.”
							- Đó là điều người ta nói. Với cách học của tôi, điều đó không thành vấn đề cho đến khi tôi cảm thấy nó không đúng. Tôi vẫn mặc ba y. Dù họ nói gì về xe, mọi thứ vẫn vậy.

						- **BBC**: Giáo lý Phật giáo nào thầy yêu thích nhất và muốn chia sẻ với mọi người?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Theo giáo lý Phật giáo, làm điều thiện là quan trọng nhất. Sau đó là hạnh phúc, hòa bình, giải thoát, và Niết bàn, những điều quan trọng nhất. Tôi cầu mong mọi người sống hạnh phúc, hưởng hòa bình. Giải thoát nghĩa là họ sống hạnh phúc hơn nữa.
						- **BBC**: Trong lúc bộ hành, thầy có nhớ gia đình không, đặc biệt khi ở nước ngoài?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Có nhớ, nhưng cũng không nhớ. Tôi có nhớ, nhưng tôi chế ngự điều đó.
							- Cha mẹ tôi sớm muộn cũng qua đời. Tôi cũng vậy. Nhớ họ không thay đổi được gì. Đau khổ, tình yêu là nguồn gốc của đau khổ, là nguồn gốc của sợ hãi. Khi hiểu được điều này, tôi không còn cảm giác về tình yêu nữa.
							- Tình yêu là tạm thời. Tôi chế ngự nó. Nếu bạn có thể giải thoát khỏi mọi thứ, bạn sẽ không còn đau khổ.
							- Biết vậy mà tôi vẫn đau khổ, tôi chấp nhận, rồi học giáo pháp của Đức Phật. Từ đó, tôi vượt qua tham ái, buồn đau, và cuối cùng thoát khỏi khổ đau.

						- Vào một buổi sáng tháng Sáu tràn đầy sự tĩnh lặng, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ lặng lẽ đi khất thực ở Gia Lai, một vùng cao nguyên miền Trung Việt Nam đầy khó khăn. Đó là nơi thầy chọn để ẩn mình sau cuộc bộ hành gây xôn xao cả nước, thu hút sự chú ý của nhiều người. Thay vì dùng bát khất thực truyền thống, thầy mang theo một **nồi cơm điện**, điều này không chỉ gây tò mò mà còn khiến nhiều người ngưỡng mộ.
						- Lý do thầy trở thành tâm điểm chú ý trong cộng đồng Phật tử gần như không cần giải thích. Sự kiên định với **13 hạnh đầu đà**, cùng lối sống tu hành đặc biệt, đã biến hành động của thầy thành một hiện tượng độc đáo. Điều này bao gồm việc đi bộ chân trần, sống bằng khất thực, tìm nơi trú ẩn trong rừng sâu, nghĩa trang, hoặc dưới bóng cây, và từ bỏ mọi luyến ái với vật chất.
						- (Image 2: Thich Minh Tue)
						  Chú thích: Có bằng chứng cho thấy thầy và các đệ tử buộc phải từ bỏ cuộc bộ hành do áp lực từ chính quyền
						- Tuy nhiên, thầy không thể tiếp tục thực hành lối sống tu hành của mình một cách bình thường, bởi hàng trăm người hâm mộ và đệ tử mới đã tìm đến thầy ở mỗi bước chân, mang theo thức ăn, chỗ nghỉ, và thậm chí quỳ lạy để bày tỏ sự tôn kính.
						- Cuộc bộ hành của thầy Thích Minh Tuệ kết thúc vào ngày 3 tháng 6, sau khi một đệ tử ([LTS, việt kiều Mỹ](https://vnexpress.net/mot-nguoi-di-theo-ong-thich-minh-tue-bi-soc-nhiet-tu-vong-4752943.html)) qua đời do sốc nhiệt trong thời tiết nóng bức tháng Năm. Chính quyền cho biết thầy tự nguyện dừng cuộc bộ hành và quyết định ẩn tu tại một địa điểm bí mật gần nhà ở Gia Lai để thực hành các nghi thức tôn giáo. Tuy nhiên, có bằng chứng cho thấy thầy và các đệ tử buộc phải từ bỏ cuộc bộ hành do áp lực từ chính quyền.

						- ## Hiện tượng độc đáo
						  collapsed:: true
							- Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ, 43 tuổi, đã thu hút một lượng lớn người theo trong cuộc bộ hành khắp đất nước. Thầy bắt đầu hành trình lặng lẽ từ năm 2017, như một chuyến đi cá nhân, chỉ ăn một bữa trước trưa mỗi ngày. Thầy đã trải qua hàng nghìn đêm ngủ trong nghĩa trang hoặc bất cứ nơi nào trong rừng.
							- Vào tháng 5 năm 2024, hành động của thầy thu hút sự chú ý rộng rãi trên Facebook, TikTok, và YouTube, khiến nhiều người có cùng chí hướng từ khắp nơi trên cả nước tìm đến tham gia cùng thầy. Từ đó, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ trở thành một nhân vật nổi tiếng trên truyền thông, và đối với nhiều người dùng YouTube, thầy trở thành nguồn thu nhập.

							  Chú thích: Hành động của thầy thu hút sự chú ý rộng rãi trên Facebook, TikTok, và YouTube
							- “Hiện tượng độc đáo liên quan đến thầy Thích Minh Tuệ” diễn ra trong bối cảnh Phật giáo Việt Nam đã biến đổi, xa rời các giá trị truyền thống. Trước khi cuộc bộ hành dừng lại, các nhóm người hành hương đầy nhiệt huyết và tận tụy đã đến để gặp, chạm vào thầy, hoặc cúng dường qua mạng xã hội, gây ra ùn tắc giao thông nghiêm trọng ở các thành phố lớn như Quảng Trị và Huế.
							- Những chuyến đi của thầy đã khơi mào các cuộc tranh luận công khai về các yếu tố cốt lõi của Phật giáo, tôn giáo chính tại Việt Nam. Hình ảnh của thầy đã góp phần vào việc chỉ trích các vị sư tham nhũng, thiếu gương mẫu, lợi dụng giáo pháp để trục lợi tài chính. Hàng loạt chùa chiền lớn được xây dựng nhờ sự tài trợ của các doanh nhân giàu có, biến một tôn giáo thành ngành công nghiệp trị giá hàng tỷ đô la, đặc biệt khi các khoản quyên góp cho các tổ chức tôn giáo được miễn thuế và không bị kiểm toán.
							- Đảng Cộng sản Việt Nam, theo chủ nghĩa vô thần, sử dụng Phật giáo để thu phục lòng dân trong một quốc gia coi tôn giáo là một phần truyền thống. Nhiều lãnh đạo cấp cao thường xuất hiện bên các vị sư cao cấp để bày tỏ sự ủng hộ.
							- (Image 5: Thich Minh Tue and other monks walking on the road)
							- Trong bối cảnh Phật giáo bị lợi dụng vì lợi ích chính trị hoặc tài chính, tham nhũng trong các tổ chức tôn giáo trở nên phổ biến. Đầu năm nay, chính quyền đã kỷ luật trụ trì chùa Bà Vàng ở miền Bắc Việt Nam vì tổ chức triển lãm “Xá lợi tóc Đức Phật” nhằm mục đích tài chính.
							- “Phong cách sống giản dị của thầy hoàn toàn khác biệt so với các vị sư ở những ngôi chùa lớn với tượng đài hoành tráng, những người nói một đằng làm một nẻo,” Thạc sĩ Bửu Nghiêm, chuyên gia về Phật giáo ứng dụng tại [Viện Nan Tien](https://www.nantien.edu.au/), Australia, chia sẻ với BBC.
							- Nhà sử học [Pascal Bourdeaux](https://www.ephe.psl.eu/pascal-bourdeaux), nổi tiếng với nghiên cứu về tôn giáo ở Việt Nam và Đông Nam Á tại École Pratique des Hautes Études, cho rằng thầy Thích Minh Tuệ là một nhân vật được kính trọng rộng rãi. Thầy có thể được xem như một phản ứng chống lại sự bất tín trong chính trị quốc gia và quốc tế, hoặc bất mãn xã hội, thông qua những ý định tâm linh và mong cầu giải thoát.

							  Chú thích: Những chuyến đi của thầy đã khơi mào các cuộc tranh luận công khai về các yếu tố cốt lõi của Phật giáo, tôn giáo chính tại Việt Nam
							- Ở Việt Nam, có vị thiền sư nổi tiếng quốc tế hơn cả trong nước đó là là [Thích Nhất Hạnh](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Nh%E1%BA%A5t_H%E1%BA%A1nh). Dù chưa đạt được sự chú ý toàn cầu như vậy, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ đã trở thành một chất xúc tác trong nước. Sự khác biệt cơ bản giữa hai vị sư rất rõ ràng: Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ không phải là một nhà thuyết pháp. Thay vào đó, thầy truyền cảm hứng qua hành động và những lời nói giản dị, khiêm tốn, chân thành. Trong một video, với khuôn mặt sưng tấy, máu chảy ở khóe miệng, thầy từ bi kể về việc bị tấn công khi đi khất thực:
							- “Khi bị đánh và thoát khỏi sự giận dữ, con cảm thấy thương xót cho những người đánh con. Con rất hoan hỉ và cầu mong họ được an lành.”
							- Bộ y áo của thầy, được may từ những mảnh vải vụn nhặt được trong các chuyến đi, kể cả ở nghĩa trang, đã truyền cảm hứng cho nhiều tác phẩm nghệ thuật, từ tranh vẽ, tượng, thơ ca đến thời trang.
							- Một đệ tử của thầy Thích Minh Tuệ nói với BBC: “Hiện tượng độc đáo liên quan đến thầy Thích Minh Tuệ là lời mời gọi rõ ràng để mọi người tự phản tỉnh. Những người từ các tầng lớp xã hội khác nhau không thể tránh khỏi việc thay đổi suy nghĩ và nhận thức.”
							- Hòa thượng Thích Sảo Quang, trụ trì một ngôi chùa ở Louisiana, Mỹ, tin rằng hiện tượng thầy Thích Minh Tuệ mang lại hy vọng. Hình ảnh giản dị và chân thành của thầy được xem như một sự đối trọng với chủ nghĩa vật chất thái quá hiện nay. Hơn nữa, câu chuyện của thầy là thông điệp dành cho các vị sư, khuyến khích ưu tiên việc giảng dạy và phát triển tâm linh hơn nhu cầu vật chất, đồng thời ảnh hưởng đến Phật giáo ngoài Việt Nam.
							- Pascal Bourdeaux so sánh hiện tượng này với Khất Sĩ, một tông phái Phật giáo lớn ở miền Nam Việt Nam, được [Minh Đăng Quang](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minh_%C4%90%C4%83ng_Quang) thành lập vào những năm 1940, cũng thực hành đi bộ và khất thực tương tự. Ông nói: “Một cách giải thích rõ ràng là người Việt Nam ngày càng quan tâm đến Phật giáo. Họ nỗ lực hiểu rõ hơn các giá trị cốt lõi của giáo pháp và triết lý Ấn Độ, hơn là các truyền thống Phật giáo Trung Quốc.”
							- Minh Đăng Quang được kính trọng rộng rãi ở miền Nam Việt Nam trước khi biến mất bí ẩn trong một chuyến bộ hành vào năm 1954, không để lại bất kỳ thông tin nào.

							- Pascal Bourdeaux cho biết một số người xem thầy Thích Minh Tuệ như một vị thầy tâm linh hoàn toàn tận tụy vì xã hội, trong khi những người khác coi thầy là một vị sư giả mạo, lợi dụng truyền thông để thao túng dư luận: “Chẳng có gì mới. Nhưng chính mạng xã hội đã tạo ra hiện tượng này.”
							- Việc trở nên nổi tiếng qua mạng xã hội mang lại cả kết quả tích cực lẫn tiêu cực. Đặc biệt ở Việt Nam, khi một người nhận được sự chú ý lớn như vậy, các vấn đề thường theo sau. Ủy ban Tự do Tôn giáo Quốc tế Hoa Kỳ (USCIRF) liệt Việt Nam vào danh sách các quốc gia đàn áp tôn giáo nghiêm trọng.
							- Khi “hiện tượng Thích Minh Tuệ” trở thành đề tài bàn tán, Giáo hội Phật giáo Việt Nam (VBS), tổ chức Phật giáo duy nhất được chính phủ công nhận, tuyên bố không công nhận thầy Thích Minh Tuệ là một vị sư. Hơn nữa, truyền thông nhà nước gọi thầy bằng tên thật thay vì pháp danh, cho thấy chính phủ Việt Nam cũng không công nhận thầy.
							- (Image 8: Thich Minh Tue)
							  Chú thích: Truyền thông nhà nước gọi thầy bằng tên thật thay vì pháp danh, cho thấy chính phủ Việt Nam không công nhận thầy
							- Thực tế, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ không tuyên bố mình là một vị sư hay thuộc bất kỳ chùa chiền, tổ chức nào dưới sự quản lý của Giáo hội Phật giáo Việt Nam. Thay vào đó, thầy tự xem mình là một người nỗ lực thực hành theo lời dạy của Đức Phật. Sự tận tụy để sống như một vị sư độc lập, cùng với sự ủng hộ ngày càng tăng xung quanh thầy, có thể là lý do chính dẫn đến sự biến mất của thầy.
							- Khi thầy Thích Minh Tuệ đột ngột biến mất vào sáng sớm ngày 3 tháng 6, nhiều người nhớ đến câu chuyện của Minh Đăng Quang, người cũng biến mất cách đây 70 năm trong lúc bộ hành chân trần.
							- Để đáp lại sự nghi ngờ của công chúng, vào ngày 8 tháng 6, Đài Truyền hình Việt Nam (VTV), do nhà nước quản lý, phát sóng một video dài 3 phút với tiêu đề “Thông tin sai lệch về thực hành của Thích Minh Tuệ” nhằm chống lại tin đồn và quảng bá chính sách của Đảng Cộng sản. Trong video, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ nói rằng thể chất và tinh thần của mình vẫn tốt, và thầy tiếp tục thực hành theo lời dạy của Đức Phật. Thầy cho biết khi không có đám đông gây rối loạn trật tự xã hội, thầy có thể tập trung vào việc tu học như thường lệ.
							- Video của truyền thông nhà nước không làm dịu nỗi lo lắng của công chúng. Hai ngày sau, cảnh sát công bố một video cho thấy thầy nhận thẻ căn cước mới và nói rằng thầy đã dừng cuộc bộ hành do lo ngại về an ninh từ việc đám đông tụ tập.
							- Tuy nhiên, hai video này, được sử dụng như một phần của chiến dịch tuyên truyền nhà nước, lại thu hút đám đông lớn hơn đến nơi thầy ẩn tu ở Gia Lai.
							- (Image 9: Thich Minh Tue and other monks walking on the road)
							- “Hiện tượng Thích Minh Tuệ khiến chính quyền bối rối. Có lẽ họ vẫn chưa thống nhất cách xử lý tình huống này. Nhờ sự hiểu biết sâu sắc về giáo pháp, ngay cả trong chính quyền cũng có nhiều người ủng hộ thầy Thích Minh Tuệ,” Bửu Nghiêm nói.
							- Sau sự xuất hiện trên truyền hình và những tin đồn tiếp theo, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ chuyển đến một khu vườn của gia đình ở Gia Lai để sống ẩn dật. Địa điểm mới này của thầy vẫn tiếp tục thu hút sự chú ý. Đám đông đầy tò mò và sùng kính vẫn tụ tập quanh khu vực thầy thực hành giáo pháp ở quê nhà, dẫn đến việc cảnh sát phải dựng rào chắn giao thông.
							- Vào ngày 13 tháng 6, em trai của thầy Thích Minh Tuệ (anh Thìn) xuất hiện trong một video trên TikTok, nói rằng thầy không còn ở khu vườn của gia đình. Trong khi đó, sáng ngày 14 tháng 6, mạng xã hội đưa tin rằng vị sư này “đã biến mất”.
							- “Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ cần được tự do sống đời sống xuất gia của mình. Theo tôi, thầy tận tụy sống theo giới luật. Việc giới hạn đời sống xuất gia của thầy trong một khu vực nhỏ làm lu mờ ý nghĩa thực sự của đời sống tu hành theo Phật giáo. Vì vậy, đây là một vấn đề khó giải quyết đối với chính quyền,” Bửu Nghiêm nói.

				- [April 18](https://economynext.com/vietnams-famed-walking-ascetic-minh-tue-in-sri-lanka-amid-obstacles-216441/): Vietnam’s famed walking ascetic Minh Tuệ in Sri Lanka amid obstacles
					- Friday April 18, 2025 2:37 pm
					- A Vietnam ascetic, who has gained widespread acclaim from the ordinary public in his country for his simple lifestyle, is facing obstacles as he is walking across Sri Lanka to reach the Buddha’s birthplace in India.
					  collapsed:: true
						- Known popularly by the sobriquet Thích Minh Tuệ, the ascetic reportedly walked across Vietnam at least four times, over several years before some youtubers and ticktockers noticed in 2024 and started following him around bringing him to national and international attention.
						- The ascetic, who’s birth [name is said to be Lê Anh Tú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Minh_Tu%E1%BB%87), walks barefoot, and is dressed in robes made of scraps of different cloth given to him by people on his travels. His alms bowl is the inner container of a rice cooker.
						- The ascetic has run into controversy with an officially sanctioned Buddhist order in Vietnam after netizens started comparing his simple lifestyle with those in the establishment.
						- According to reports Minh Tuệ has not claimed to be an official monk, but only a student of Buddhist teachings and is following dhutanga practices ([asceticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asceticism))
						- Though others refer to him as ‘Thích’ (Venerable) he always refers to himself simply as ‘con’ in the way students refer to themselves when addressing teachers, reports say.
						- Vietnam regional authorities also reportedly urged Minh Tuệ to stop walking last year as large crowds followed when he entered larger townships bringing city traffic to a standstill.
						- For a while he disappeared off the main roads, leading to speculation and concern among his internet followers. In December 2024, Minh Tuệ had started a pilgrimage to India to reach the birthplace of the Buddha, walking across several countries including Laos and Thailand.
						- He was originally planning to go to India across Myanmar but could not secure entry and had instead traveled to Malaysia and ended up in Sri Lanka.
						- After landing in Sri Lanka he had started walking across the island towards Jaffna. Youtube videos show he arrived in Sri Lanka from Singapore.
					- According to a senior monk from the Ambarukkarama Temple of Mugurugampala in Sri Lanka who is helping the ascetic, the group is facing difficulties after another senior Sri Lankan monk asked temples not to harbhour him.
					  collapsed:: true
						- The group of over 30 ascetics and Vietnamese lay followers had landed in Sri Lanka on April 12 and also stayed at his own Temple on the New Year’s day.
						- “From our observations these people are very harmless, responsible and act with much discipline (vinyawath),” the thero explained.
						- “They are engaged in a Dhutangadari practices and are walking barefoot.
						- “We thought we should treat these visitors from Vietnam as befits our traditions of hospitality. If some harm befalls them it is not good for the honour of our country.
						- “But following some communications with a Bhikkhu in Vietnam with one of our Bhikkhus, a wrong impression  has been created, there has been some problems caused to the lay Vietnamese persons who followed them.
						- “Some temples have also refused to accommodate them. So two of us from our temple decided to stay with them and help them until they leave our country and treat them with kindness and compassion (karuna and maithree).
						- A senior Sri Lankan monk had placed a whatsapp message which he said has caused problems for the group.
						- “Instead of writing whatsapp messages without inquiry, I appeal kindly to examine this matter and act in a way that preserves the dignity of our country,” the thero said.
						- “Our foreign service officials, and responsible monks should examine this matter and take the actions required for them to stay lawfully.

							- {{video https://youtu.be/GnCnpUwNUMA}}
					- Meanwhile questions appeared to have been raised whether they could walk on the roads after coming on a tourist visa, the thero said. The ascetic is planning to go to Anuradhapura and to Jaffna, he said.
					- It is not clear what the problem is with walking using a tourist visa on a Buddhist trail, as other visitors go on Tea trails and Ramayana trails.
					- He is not known for preaching on his trip to India, and only sometimes answers questions.
					  collapsed:: true
						- “My journey is a lifelong walk,” the ascetic was quoted as saying by [VNExpress portal](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/pilgrim-spends-6-years-traversing-vietnam-on-foot-4747732.html) last May.  “I don’t intend to spread any message, as everything in Buddhism has been taught by the Buddha.
						- “I just want to practice per the teachings of the Buddha to complete myself. When I walk, I pray for everyone to always be happy with their families.”
						- The Vietnamese ascetic was staying the night on that day in a sawmill, and it was unseemly as there were 11,000 temples in Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan thero observed.
						- The ascetic however carries a bedroll with him and reportedly sleeps in forest patches and cemeteries among other places as he walks about in his own country.
					- Sri Lanka’s Aruna newspaper reported that the Chief Prelate of the Malwatte Chapter has written to the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs asking for an immigration inquiry.
					- The request has been triggered following a letter said to have been sent by a senior monk from a state recognized Buddhist order. Youtube videos showed the a copy of the letter, which was claimed to have been given by police to the group.

					- Friday, 18 April 2025 12:16 ([RFA.org](https://www.rfa.org/))
					- A Vietnamese Buddhist monk on a barefoot pilgrimage from his homeland to India ran into some unexpected opposition in Sri Lanka on the latest leg of his circuitous journey around Asia.
					- A witness told Radio Free Asia that when the Vietnamese monk Thich Minh Tue and his entourage were about to go to a local Hindu temple to rest, _**a local monk**, claiming to be from the Sri Lankan Buddhist Sangha, came to the temple and **asked that he not stay**._
					- Local Sri Lankans objected, taking sides with their Vietnamese visitor.
					  id:: 684f9519-0c18-4a6d-9dee-9d68df7b300a
					  The Sri Lankan monk then took out his phone and read the contents of a letter allegedly sent by Thich Nhat Tu, a representative of the state-backed Vietnam Buddhist Sangha – or religious association - to the Sri Lankan Sangha, to justify his demand that Thich Minh Tue leave the leafy temple compound in Giriulla, a town about 30 miles northeast of the capital Colombo.
					- “He pointed to the letter and read the content to prove that this group of monks are a fake monks and were violating the law,” said Nguyen Minh Chi, a Vietnamese filmmaker who witnessed the exchange.
					  collapsed:: true
						- The letter is visible in video and photos of the incident, filmed by YouTubers accompanying Thich Minh Tue.
						- RFA has not been able to verify the authenticity of the letter. It bears a signature and the name of Thich Nhat Tu, along with the seal of the International Buddhist Council of the Vietnamese sangha, for which he serves as deputy head.
						- Thich Minh Tue was eventually able to enter the temple.
						- He became an unlikely internet sensation last year in Vietnam, where his simple lifestyle has struck a chord. His barefoot walks went viral and well-wishers came out in droves.
						- Last December, he left Vietnam on a journey by foot to India, the birthplace of Buddhism. After crossing Laos, he entered Thailand with a plan to hike across conflict-wracked Myanmar, but ran into logistical and visa problems. He has since traveled to Malaysia, and a week ago arrived in Sri Lanka, a predominantly Buddhist nation. He still hopes to make it to India.
						- His expedition is not without controversy. Vietnam’s state-sanctioned Buddhist sangha has not officially recognized him as a monk. At one point, before his international wanderings began, authorities in communist Vietnam, leery of his popularity, announced he had “voluntarily retired.”
					- A statement was posted Wednesday on two Facebook pages linked to Thich Nhat Tu, the representative of the Vietnamese sangha, **denying he wrote the letter**.
					  collapsed:: true
						- It includes a section calling for close cooperation between the Vietnamese and Sri Lankan sanghas on the issue of Thich Minh Tue, saying that it is a matter related to “national order and security.”
						- One follower of Thich Minh Tue voiced exasperation about the controversy.
						- “Why do people who practice Buddhism together constantly fight each other?” asked Phuoc Nghiem in a video he posted Wednesday. “We’re only practicing (religion), but they keep filing complaints.”

					- April 18, 2025
					- The Most Venerable Thibbatuwawe Sri Sumangala Maha Thero, the Chief Prelate of the Malwatta Chapter, has issued a special letter to the Commissioner for Buddhist Affairs, urging immediate action to prevent the arrival of a group of Vietnamese monks previously deported from Thailand and Indonesia due to alleged anti-Buddhist activities. The Thero has also requested that the security forces be informed accordingly.
					  collapsed:: true
						- According to the letter, the group in question — including an individual named Lay An Tu — is accused of engaging in activities that are harmful to Buddhism. It is also noted that the organization they represent is banned in Vietnam. This information has been confirmed by Dr. Kiew Nhat Tu, Chairman of the International Buddhist Department of Ho Chi Minh City, who officially communicated the concerns to the Chief Prelate.
						- The letter highlights that the group is currently attempting to _enter Sri Lanka on **tourist visas** for pilgrimage purposes_. The Chief Prelate warns that such actions pose a serious threat to the sanctity of Buddhism and the public perception of Buddhist monks. He has therefore called for immediate measures to halt their activities, citing violations of visa regulations and the potential for reputational damage to Sri Lankan Buddhism on the international stage.

					- By Ruki Fernando & Manushika Cooray
					- Minh Tue is a Vietnamese who describes himself as an ordinary learner and practising what Buddha has taught in scripture. He has been walking in Vietnam barefoot, eating once a day (only in the morning) from food received from others, sleeping in the open, and not receiving any money. He has no possessions, except some bare essentials like a bowl for food and to drink water. His robes are sown by himself; using discarded pieces of cloth he picks up along his travels.
					- Minh Tue’s simple lifestyle and attempts to follow Buddha was seen by many Vietnamese as a contrast to traditional Buddhist Sanga in Vietnam, who were seen as politically aligned to repressive Vietnamese government and having affluent lifestyles. Minh Tue had become very popular amongst Vietnamese, including those outside Vietnam, with crowds following him physically in his walks and many more following him spiritually.
					- He had walked beyond Vietnam to other neighbouring countries such as Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore. Some of his followers had followed him even during overseas travels. Vietnamese volunteers have travelled with him to see him and help him, including those of Vietnamese origin from countries such as Singapore, Australia, United States of America and United Kingdom. Youtubers and media have also followed him and kept his followers informed of his travels.
					- Minh Tue had arrived in Sri Lanka on April 10, 2025 and received a visa for 30 days; his travel documents were seen by the authors of this article. He had hoped to walk to Jaffna and travel from there to India before the expiry of his visa. He had started walking from the day of his arrival and managed to walk from Katunayake to around Narammala till April 17.
					- During the walks, Minh Tue and his followers, numbering about 34 (plus about 10 helpers), remain silent; each participant walking behind each other, in meditative manner, quite similar to the way some Sri Lankan monks walk during ‘pinda patha’. This way of their walking ensures that there is no disruption to pedestrian or vehicular traffic or public order. Sri Lankans have not observed any reports of public disorder caused by their walking in this island.
					- Allegations against Min Tue
					  collapsed:: true
						- On April 13, the Committee for International Buddhist Affairs of the Vietnamese Buddhist Sangha has sent a letter to the Mahanayaka of the Malwatta Chapter making allegations against Minh Tue. The letter was seen by the authors of this article. The allegations include; donning Buddhist monastic robes without being ordained, attempting to form a dissident sect, causing division and damaging the reputation and unity of Vietnamese Buddhism and threatening Public Order and National reputation. The letter also stated that Minh Tue is supported by anti-government individuals and organizations that seek to use his image to discredit the Vietnamese government and divide the Buddhist Sanga. But specific details of allegations or evidence indicating the allegations were not provided.
						- The letter requests the Mahanayaka Thera of the Malwatta Chapter to coordinate with Sri Lankan authorities to verify and prevent Minh Tue and his group from engaging in any religious or public activities in Sri Lanka, provide assistance to liaise with Sri Lankan authorities to address cases where religious identities are exploited as a cover for political subversion, undermining the unity of Vietnamese Buddhism and sovereignty of the Vietnamese state.
						- These writers came to know from multiple Vietnamese sources that allegations in the letter are false and that it’s a group of Buddhist Sanga in Vietnam close to the Vietnamese government which is hostile to Minh Tue due to his growing popularity amongst ordinary Vietnamese.
						- Media have reported that Vietnamese Government had obstructed Minh Tue’s walks in Vietnam.
						- Minh Tue has responded to the above allegations, a translation of which was seen by these authors.  He maintains that he is not a monk or teacher and that he doesn’t carry the name “Thich”, which he says belongs to Buddha. He also says he is not part of the Vietnam Buddhist Association and doesn’t wear Buddhist robes and that he is not impersonating anyone.
					- Mixed responses from Sri Lanka
					  collapsed:: true
						- On or around April 16, in Giriulla, a witness has told the media that when Minh Tue and his group were about to visit a local Hindu temple to rest, a local Buddhist monk had objected, citing the above letter. The local monk had claimed that Minh Tue and the group which was with him were “fake monks and were violating the law”. But Sri Lankans have sympathised with the Vietnamese. Eventually Minh Tue was eventually able to enter the temple.
						- The Deputy Registrar of the Malwatta Chapter, Mahawela Rathanapala Thera, is reported to have told BBC Sinhala that the Chairman of the Department of Buddhism in Vietnam has made a written request to the Malwatta Mahanayaka Thera, informing him not to allow the anti-Sasana activities of this Vietnamese group. The Deputy Registrar is reported to have stated that these people are ‘monks in disguise’ and that they are not ordained according to the Buddhist Vinaya and that the Chief Incumbent of the Malwatta Vihara Chapter had requested the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs to investigate the facts regarding this ‘Vietnamese group’ and take action regarding the violation of visa conditions through the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration. Speaking to BBC Sinhala, the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs is reported to have said that steps have been taken to inform the Department of Immigration and Emigration to take necessary action based on the letter received from the Malwatta Mahanayake Thera.
					- Police stop Minh Tue
					  collapsed:: true
						- These writers visited Minh Tue, some of his followers and helpers on April 21. They informed that the police had stopped them from walking on April 17 and verbally informed them that they were not allowed to walk on a tourist visa. No written orders or instructions have been presented by the police.
						- The Police Media Spokesperson Senior Superintendent of Police Buddhika Manathunga is reported to have told BBC Sinhala that “a pada yathra is an activity that falls under the category of a procession”. He is further reported to have said, “You need to get permission from the police to hold a procession. The second thing is that according to the Immigration and Emigration Law, you cannot come to Sri Lanka on a visit visa and hold a demonstration. Based on all those facts, we informed them that this was illegal and therefore they were required to obtain permission to carry out this activity. Accordingly, they stopped this activity in the Kuliyapitiya area,” said SSP Manathunga.
					- Hostility shown by Immigration Department
					  collapsed:: true
						- On April 22, these writers came to know from one of Minh Tue’s helpers that some officers from the Investigation Unit of the Department of Immigration and Emigration had visited Minh Tue and his group and instructed all of them to leave Sri Lanka by April 26, despite all of them having valid Sri Lankan visas to remain in the island till May 30 (30 days from arrival on 10th April).
						- This and the restriction on walking had led to Ming Tue and group purchasing air tickets to cut short their visit in Sri Lanka and travel to India on night of April 24.
						- Immigration officers had confiscated six passports of volunteers helping Minh Tue and his followers and the officers had instructed a representative from the group to come to the Immigration office within 2 days to receive instructions about their stay and actions that will be taken with regard to their confiscated passports. Some representatives visited the Immigration office the next day (April 23) and their passports were returned, but not before spending several hours at the Department of Immigration and Emigration. Their return are tickets were also inspected. However, immigration officers didn’t issue any written or verbal instructions that their visa was being revoked or its duration was reduced. Department of Immigration and Emigration officers verbally informed the group, two Sri Lankan Buddhist Monks and Sri Lankan activists (including one of the authors) supporting the Vietnamese that they had no opposition with Minh Tue and his group’s walking.
						- On the night of April 24, Minh Tue and the group left Sri Lanka for India. Minh Tue had told these two writers that his policy was to obey orders of relevant authorities of any country and not remain in places where he wasn’t welcome.
						- The media had also had reported this.
						- Minh Tue’s premature departure – a loss for Sri Lanka
						- These writers met several Sri Lankans who have been assisting Ming Tue and it seemed that most Sri Lankans were very supportive and welcoming towards the visit and walking of Minh Tue and his followers. Amongst these were two Buddhist Monks and a man who shared with us their many efforts to ensure Minh Tue and group could stay in Sri Lanka and continue their journey towards Jaffna. They had also intervened to find places for the group to rest, when some Buddhist Monks had been reluctant to extend a welcoming hand.
						- These writers came to hear that Ming Tue’s helpers had financially assisted Sri Lankan communities through charitable acts during the course of their walk. It was also clear to us that this group was contributing to the Sri Lankan economy, by patronising Sri Lankan shops, hotels, transport providers etc. These writers felt that the group’s presence and walking have been contributing to nurture the friendship between the people of Sri Lanka and Vietnam; especially amongst Buddhists and that Sri Lanka had much to benefit spiritually from Minh Tue’s presence in Sri Lanka even for 30 days.
						- Is walking to Jaffna a violation of tourist visa conditions?
						- Walking or seeking alms or engaging in religious activities is not prohibited for persons with tourist visas as per the official website of the Department of Immigration or Emigration. Many tourists in Sri Lanka openly engage in religious practices, a very common example being tourists participating in annual processions (which lead to closure of roads) linked to major Buddhist temples such as “Dalada Maligawa” in Kandy and “Gangaramaya” in Colombo. It is also very common to see tourists doing long walks spanning several days and weeks through public spaces, a prominent example being the “Pekoe Trail”.
						- Article 10 of the Sri Lankan constitution guarantees Freedom of thought, conscience and religion, including the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice for all persons, not just Sri Lankan citizens. Article 12 (1) of the constitution ensures all persons (not just citizens) are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law. Article 11 of the constitution guarantees that no person (not only citizens) shall be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which includes mental torture.
						- Minh Tue was simply travelling on foot to Jaffna and not engaging in a procession or Pada Yatra. He had not organised or joined any religious activities in Sri Lanka. He has chosen the means of travel in Sri Lanka as walking, according to his conscience and religion. Walking as a means of travel is not prohibited by Sri Lankan law. It’s similar to travelling by cycling, car, bus, train etc.
						- Thus, these writers feel that the decision taken by the Sri Lanka Police to prohibit Minh Tue and his followers from walking to Jaffna appears to have no legal basis and has violated articles 10, 12(2) and 11 of Sri Lanka’s Constitution.
						- The prohibition of walking by this very popular spiritual leader with Buddhist background, from a neighbouring country, with largely Buddhist population, may lead to tensions amongst people in Sri Lanka and may obstruct friendly relations between the people of Vietnam and Sri Lanka. It may also bring Sri Lanka into disrepute.
						- Minh Tue and his group may visit Sri Lanka again if they are welcomed and supported. Many hope they do. These writers are confident that most Sri Lankans, especially Buddhists, will welcome and support them. Importantly, these writers hope that the state and especially the police will ensure their journey isn’t obstructed by those who may have vested interests; whether from Vietnam or Sri Lanka.

				- Nãy ngồi thiền vào sâu bên trong, mình thấy thiệt là "khủng!" Nhớ những chuyến đi ra thiên nhiên, mình thấy cả trong ngoài đều khủng như nhau. 😁
				- Trong triết học Phương Tây có khái niệm "the Sublime" (cái Khủng) diễn tả tính 2 mặt của những thứ vĩ đại như thiên nhiên, vũ trụ, Chúa Trời, và sự vượt qua cả 2 mặt đó:
					- Ở xa, khi thu gọn cái to lớn vĩ đại vào tầm mắt thì ta thấy nó thật đẹp, có sức hút mãnh liệt khiến ta phải đi tới để khám phá.
					- Khi tới gần, mình mới ngộ ra nó thật là khủng khiếp, đầy những cạm bẫy, nguy hiểm... Sự vĩ đại của nó đè bẹp cái tôi của mình, khiến mình nhận ra mình chỉ là một hạt bụi nhỏ bé, chả là gì cả.
					- Khi vượt qua được chính mình, bỏ được cái tôi nhỏ bé này xuống để hòa vào sự hùng vĩ, to lớn đó, mình bỗng thấy thật tuyệt vời, một cảm giác thăng hoa (sublime), vượt thoát (transcendental), và giải thoát (liberated). Ở đây mình ngộ ra rằng vẻ đẹp kia mời gọi mình không phải để dùng sức người nhỏ bé này để chinh phục cái ngọn núi vĩ đại để đứng trên đỉnh núi thấy "ta cao hơn núi" như mình đã tưởng. Mà sự vượt qua chính là vượt qua bản thân mình, thoát khỏi sự nô lệ cho những nghiệp trong cái tôi này: sợ hãi, kiêu ngạo, cố chấp, kỳ vọng, v.v.
				- Cái Khủng: Derived from "khủng khiếp" (terrifying, overwhelming), it carries a dual nature—both awe-inspiring grandeur and a sense of fear or intensity. This is aligned with the philosophical concept of the Sublime, as defined by thinkers like Burke (terror and beauty) or Kant (the vastness of overwhelming reason), which includes both uplifting and unsettling dimensions.
				- Về chữ Nôm thì có 2 chữ thể hiện 2 sắc thái ý nghĩa như sau
					- 恐 (khủng): khủng khiếp, khủng hoảng, khủng bố
					- 孔 (khổng, khủng): khủng long (rồng khổng lồ), "thật khủng!" (casual meaning: stupendous, tremendous)
				- > The passion caused by the great and sublime in nature, when those causes operate most powerfully is Astonishment, and astonishment is that state of the soul in which all its motions are suspended, with some degree of horror … No passion so effectually robs the mind of all its powers of acting and reasoning as fear. For fear, being an apprehension of pain or death, operates in a manner that resembles actual pain. Whatever therefore is terrible, with regard to sight, is sublime too … Indeed terror is in all cases whatsoever, either more openly or latently, the ruling principle of the sublime.

			- This morning, 23 May, on the way to company, contemplating ((6830664a-06e8-418d-bf46-0491fef3a780)), i see that i'm still too humble to be with the Great Lie, and still hiding in the cave with my Naked Truth.
			- I'm still struggling in the transiton [(3)→(4)](((68306c82-0709-4c83-bcf2-a9015af8b86e))) from living the naked Truth to dressing the Lie.
			- The **Coin of Truth**
			  id:: 6830645a-93b9-4c90-929f-8740f40c2b15
				- The Coin of Truth (Great Truth) is also the Coin of Lie (Great Lie) which is greater than both one-sided Truth and Lie.

						- Truth side: Goddess [Veritas](https://legendaryladieshub.com/goddess-veritas/) with laurels on her hair depicting her triumph over Lie.
						- Lie side: Mendax is the deceiver with witchcraft
					- The normal stereotypes & symbols of Truth and Lie are just the cover of deeper truth, so this is also the [Coin of Lie](((6830664a-06e8-418d-bf46-0491fef3a780))).
					- The fable of the twins of [Well-Dressed Lie and Naked Truth](((683006ab-8151-40ff-b1a3-5499aebd355a))) reveals the inner truth which is opposite to those superficial stereotypes: Veritas is just the well dressed Lie, and Mendax is actually the naked Truth.
				- While the Truth and the Lie are 2 opposite sides of the Coin, the Great Lie and the Great Truth are 2 aspects, 2 connotations of the Coin.
				- The **Great Truth**
				  id:: 68306652-f922-4597-bcf7-99a62ef32c94
				  is simply the Coin of Truth including both Truth and Lie.

					- identity (face) = perspective (side) = mặt
					  id:: 68347151-822b-4773-8ad0-2f1d8c300191
						- Truth and Lie are just two identities, [two faces](((68346b4d-6704-4012-94b6-581694788547))) of the same subject. These identities are constructed by the collective karma, illustrated by the folks in two towns in the fable.
						- The “coin” symbol shows that Truth and Lie are just two perspectives viewed from two different angles, hence two sides of the same object.
						- It's interesting that in Vietnamese, these two expressions are unified by a single word: mặt = face = side!
				- The **Great Lie**
				  id:: 6830664a-06e8-418d-bf46-0491fef3a780
				  is the skillful means to express ((68306652-f922-4597-bcf7-99a62ef32c94)) without inflicting suffering, based on the acceptance of the intrinsic “lie” caused by differences between views.

								- The Coin of Truth contains 2 views of the same thing on its two sides. The Left side depicts a beautiful lotus 🪷 seen from above water with circular ripples spreading out from the petiole (no leaf). The Right side depicts the scene under water with the muddy rough bottom covering the lotus roots and rhizomes. Please make sure the correct anatomy of the lotus roots right under the petioles and between the horizontal rhizomes, as shown in [this diagram](((683463e2-d067-42a6-84f3-fcad587e2569))).

						- The well-dressed Lie’s noble lie is a compassionate but incomplete act, showing only the good side to protect society.

					- Giả Dối Tinh Vi và Chân Thật Trần Trụi như hai thái cực chẳng đội trời chung... nhưng kỳ thực lại là hai chị em sinh đôi, tuy 2 mà 1. Vì lòng yêu thương con người vô hạn mà họ đã chấp nhận biến ra thành hai thái cực đối lập để làm hài lòng mọi người.

						- Bản tóm gọn
							- Ngày xưa, có hai chị em sinh đôi giống hệt nhau, sống ở hai thị trấn khác nhau, nơi họ được gọi là “Chân Thật” một cách trìu mến. Người ở thị trấn này đã hoang mang khi gặp cô Chân Thật ở thị trấn kia vì họ không thể phân biệt với cô Chân Thật ở thị trấn này qua khuôn mặt nhưng lại bám chấp vào sự quen thuộc và e dè với trang phục lạ lẫm, nên đã gọi cô kia là “Giả Dối” và xua đuổi cô. Đau lòng về việc hai thị trấn tranh cãi đâu là “Chân Thật thực sự” và chiến đấu với nhau để bảo vệ Chân Thật của mình, hai chị em đã gặp nhau trong hang động để tìm cách giải quyết.
							- ― Chúng ta vốn là một nhưng lại bị chia cắt bởi định kiến của họ – cô em khóc nức nở.
							  ― Chị sẽ nhường lại hết quần áo cho em để em làm hài lòng cả hai thị trấn – cô chị nêu ý kiến.
							  ― Nhưng chị sẽ bị trần trụi và bị khinh miệt!
							  ― Vì tình yêu con người, chị sẽ chịu đựng. Còn em sẽ đảm nhận việc làm họ hài lòng, một nhiệm vụ khó chẳng kém chị đâu!
							- Họ ôm nhau lệ rơi lả chả, rồi chia tay – cô em mang hết áo quần đi, cô chị ở lại trần truồng. Để làm hài lòng mọi người, cô em trở lại thị trấn, nhanh chóng thay đổi trang phục cho phù hợp với mong đợi của từng người, đảm bảo ai cũng thoải mái với “Chân Thật” của mình. Dù khéo léo đến đâu, đôi khi cô vẫn bị bắt gặp trong lúc thay đồ và bị gọi là “Giả Dối”. Cô chị trần truồng thường phải trốn trong hang để tránh làm người ta bị sốc. Hễ thấy cô, người ta gọi cô là “đồ điên” hay còn tệ hơn nữa, rồi hoảng sợ bỏ chạy vì bất an và sợ hãi; một số người còn lạm dụng cô trong đêm.
							- Chỉ có vài người tìm đến Chân Thật trong hang, sau khi đã chán ngán với Giả Dối bị che đậy.
							  ― Sao em lại trốn ở đây? – họ hỏi.
							  ― Em đã trao vẻ đẹp lại cho em gái để phục vụ các anh – cô đáp – vì các anh sợ sự thật trần trụi.
							- Khi Chân Thật trần trụi lộ ra hoàn toàn thì hầu hết những người tìm kiếm sự thật đều hoảng loạn, bỏ chạy, và đuổi theo một “Chân Thật” khác thoải mái hơn, vốn là Giả Dối của kẻ khác. Chỉ những ai dũng cảm đối diện và đón nhận Chân Thật trần trụi thì mới ở lại và trân trọng cô.

							- Ngày xưa, vào buổi bình minh của nền văn minh nhân loại, có hai chị em sinh đôi giống hệt nhau từ lúc mới sinh. Từ nhỏ, cả hai đều xinh đẹp một cách thuần khiết và rất dễ thương dễ mến. Khi lớn lên, họ phải tách ra để đến những nơi khác nhau, người chị về phía đông và người em về phía tây, để sống và làm những công việc khác nhau. Họ được mọi người xung quanh yêu mến đến độ người dân ở thị trấn phía đông gọi cô chị là “Chân Thật” với ý bao hàm tất cả những đức tính tốt lành, và cô em cũng được người ở thị trấn phía tây gọi là “Chân Thật” với đầy ưu ái như vậy. Một ngày nọ, cô chị qua thị trấn phía tây để thăm em gái. Lúc đầu, mọi người ở đó nhầm lẫn hai chị em với nhau vì khuôn mặt họ không thể nào phân biệt được và đều cùng tên là “Chân Thật”. Nhưng rồi họ nhận ra cô Chân Thật của mình qua bộ áo đầm quen thuộc. Họ gọi cô mặc bộ đồ lạ kia là “Giả Dối”:
								- Mày không phải là Chân Thật!
								- Em là Chân Thật mà! Chúng em là chị em sinh đôi cùng tên mà!
								- Nếu vậy thì mày chỉ là Chân Thật giả chứ không phải Chân Thật thật!
								- Em chỉ là một bé Chân Thật khác, giống như em của em thôi.
								- Không, chúng tôi không tin chuyện vớ vẩn như vậy đâu! Chỉ có một Chân Thật. Mày đang nói dối! Mày là Giả Dối, không phải Chân Thật! Mày là đồ giả hình, giả dạng, giả tạo,...
								  Người dân ở đó quy mọi điều xấu xa nhất cho cô chị qua tên gọi “Giả Dối” và họ giận dữ đuổi cô ra khỏi thị trấn phía tây. Cô em phải đi cùng chị mình về phía đông để bảo vệ chị gái khỏi những người hung dữ kia và để cô chị về nhà được an toàn. Nhưng khi họ vào thị trấn phía đông, cô em cũng gặp phải tình huống tương tự: Cô bị gọi là “Giả Dối”, bị sỉ nhục và bị đuổi khỏi thị trấn phía đông.
							- Sự phân biệt đối xử đó không chỉ khiến hai chị em đau khổ, mà còn khiến người dân hai thị trấn gây hấn với nhau để bảo vệ “Chân Thật” yêu quý của họ khỏi bị gọi là “Giả Dối” và bị xúc phạm bởi người thị trấn bên kia. Vì yêu quý mọi người nên hai chị em lẩn vào một hang động để cùng nhau tìm cách giải quyết xung đột này.
								- Đau buồn quá em ơi! Tệ quá em ơi!
								- Em cũng buồn. Nhưng chúng ta phải làm gì đó để chấm dứt sự hỗn loạn này!
								- Giá như chúng ta chẳng phải xa nhau, giá như chúng ta là một...
								- Dạ! Chị nói đúng, chúng ta phải là một, không thể tách làm hai được!
								- Nhưng bằng cách nào???
								- Thực ra thì bản chất chúng ta đã là một rồi... Chỉ có điều là người ta kỳ thị chị em mình bằng những thành kiến của họ và bằng những bộ áo bên ngoài của chúng ta mà thôi...
								- À, đúng rồi! Chỉ là cái bộ áo!!! Là chính nó, bộ áo!!! Chị sẽ đưa em quần áo của chị để em có thể mặc những trang phục khác nhau 👗🥻 ở những nơi khác nhau để em luôn phù hợp với văn hoá ở đó dù em có đi bất cứ nơi đâu. Như vậy thì người ở thị trấn phía tây sẽ coi em là người phía tây và người ở thị trấn phía đông sẽ coi em là người phía đông. Như vậy sẽ không còn ai buồn phiền chi nữa.
								- Còn chị thì sao?!!!
								- Đừng lo lắng cho chị! Trong tim chúng ta vẫn chỉ là một ♥️. Em thì thực hiện nhiệm vụ khó đó là làm hài lòng mọi người, còn chị thì hỗ trợ họ mỗi khi họ ngã xuống.
								- Không, em không thể làm vậy được! Thật bất công cho chị quá! Em không thể lấy quần áo của chị... Hic...
								- Em không còn yêu thương người ta nữa phải không?
								- Không, không, có chứ! Em yêu mọi người rất nhiều... nhưng...
								- Nhưng em lại không muốn hy sinh cho những người mình yêu thương sao?! Đừng bi quan em nhé! Sự hy sinh của chúng ta sẽ rất có ích cho mọi người trên khắp thế giới.
								- Em... em hiểu rồi... em sẽ thay mặt chị cố gắng hết sức để làm hài lòng mọi người. Em sẽ nhớ chị nhiều lắm, hic, hic...
								- Chị cũng sẽ nhớ em! Chị sẽ luôn ở bên em... trong trái tim em ♥️!
								  Hai chị em ôm nhau, khóc rất nhiều, rồi chia tay, cô em lấy hết quần áo đi còn cô chị thì trần trụi ở lại.
							- Cô em luyện tập kỹ năng thay đồ nhanh như chớp, như một phép thuật biến hình để có thể đáp ứng nhiều sở thích khác nhau của nhiều kiểu người khác nhau bất kỳ lúc nào họ cần. Nhờ kỹ năng điêu luyện mà cô đã khiến mọi người hài hòng, ai cũng nghĩ rằng mình đã có Chân Thật của riêng mình, nên không còn gây hấn với nhau nữa. Mọi người cũng thoả mãn hơn với bản thân vì họ không còn bị cô Giả Dối kia quấy rầy nữa. Tuy họ vẫn còn thấy Giả Dối lảng vảng ngoài kia, nhưng nó là Giả Dối của người khác chứ chẳng bao giờ tới gần mình nữa.
							- Xấu hổ nên cô chị trần trụi thường phải trốn trong hang để tránh làm cho người ta sốc. Nhưng tình yêu thương con người đã khiến cô lẻn vào thị trấn để trông nom họ. Những lần xuất hiện hiếm hoi của cô đã nhắc nhở mọi người về sự tồn tại của những sự thật trần trụi mà lại khó thấy và khó chấp nhận. Ban ngày, đa phần người ta đều ngoảnh mặt quay lưng với Chân Thật trần trụi, họ gọi cô ta là “đồ điên”, có người lăng mạ cô, có người nổi giận đuổi cô đi. Còn ban đêm thì có người lại tìm Chân Thật trần trụi để hiếp dâm. Vì yêu người, cô chịu đựng hết thảy!
							- Dù khéo léo đến đâu, thỉnh thoảng cô em nhiều áo quần cũng bị người ta bắt gặp khi đang thay đồ. Những người này thất vọng vô cùng khi thấy Chân Thật của họ xuất hiện dưới những diện mạo khác không hề quen thuộc. Họ càng không thể chịu được khi biết ra rằng Chật Thật của họ lại chính là Giả Dối của người khác.
								- Này Chân Thật, không thể tin được là em đã lừa dối tôi suốt bây lâu nay! Không, em không phải là Chân Thật, em là Giả Dối!!!
								- Em xin lỗi đã làm anh thất vọng! Nhưng em không lừa dối anh. Em chỉ cố gắng hết sức để làm anh hài lòng thôi.
								- Vậy rốt cuộc thì em là Chân Thật hay Giả Dối?
								- Em là Chân Thật khéo léo, nhưng mọi người cũng gọi em là là “Giả Dối” như anh vừa gọi đó.
								- Không không không! Tôi không muốn nói chuyện với Giả Dối! Biến đi!
								- Em chỉ nói cho anh biết sự thật thôi, nhưng anh không chịu chấp nhận thì em cũng chịu thua. Hãy gặp chị gái của em, có thể chị ấy sẽ giúp được anh...
								- Cô ta ở đâu?
								- Chị ấy đang trốn trong hang.
							- Hầu hết những người này chỉ để cho nỗi thất vọng của họ cuốn trôi theo thời gian. Chỉ có một số ít người cất công tìm tới hang động để gặp Chân Thật trần trụi.
								- Hú uu! Có ai đó không?
								- Dạ, có em đây.
								- Sao em lại trốn trong đây?
								- Vì em không muốn làm anh sợ.
								- Anh không sợ, hãy bước ra đi!
							- Chân Thật trần trụi chỉ mới hé ra một chút...
								- Aaahh... gớm quá!!! Sao em lại bẩn thỉu hôi hám đến vậy?
								- Vì em đã đưa hết quần áo đẹp đẽ thơm tho cho em gái rồi, là con Chân Thật khéo léo đã phục vụ anh, làm anh hài lòng bấy lâu nay đó. Nó cũng chính là con Giả Dối tinh vi đã khiến anh vừa mới thất vọng đó thôi.
								- Đừng gọi tên nó trước mặt tôi! Tôi ghét nó lắm!
								- Anh đến đây để làm gì?
								- Để tìm ra Chân Thật thực sự.
								- Em chỉ là Chân Thật trần trụi. Em không biết Chân Thật thực sự của anh là ai.
								- Em chắc chắn là Chân Thật thực sự rồi! Bước ra hẳn đi em! Anh khao khát gặp em quá rồi!
							- Khi Chân Thật trần trụi lộ diện ra hết, hầu như ai cũng đều sợ hãi bỏ chạy trở về thị trấn. Ở đó, họ mò mẫm tìm cho bằng được “Chân Thật đích thực” của riêng mình mà không biết rằng đó chỉ là Giả Dối tinh vi trong một trong bộ áo khác mà họ chưa từng biết đến.
							- Rất ít người quay lại với Chân Thật trần trụi. Họ là những người tuy đã thưởng thức được nhiều hình dáng đẹp đẽ khác nhau của Chân Thật khéo léo rồi nhưng vẫn cảm thấy có gì đó còn thiếu thốn.
								- Chào bóng tối, anh quay lại với em đây!
								- Rất vui được gặp lại anh! Bây giờ anh muốn gì?
								- Anh muốn em, chỉ mình em thôi, cho dù em đáng sợ, bẩn thỉu, ghê tởm hay xấu xa bỉ ổi đến cỡ nào đi chăng nữa!
								- Tại sao?
								- Vì anh chán con Giả Dối tinh vi lắm rồi.
								- Anh cũng sẽ sớm chán em thôi!
								- Mặc kệ! Hãy nói cho anh biết tại làm sao mà em lại ra xấu xa ghê tởm đến như vậy!?
								- Vì em đã trao hết mọi sự tốt lành cho em gái rồi, con Chân Thật khéo léo đó.
								- Để làm gì?
								- Để phục vụ những người như anh, để làm cho mọi người vui vẻ và hài lòng.
								- Sao em không tự làm lấy việc đó?
								- Chuyện ai làm không phải là vấn đề! Chúng em tuy hai cơ thể nhưng chỉ có một tâm hồn. Nếu em gánh lấy trách nhiệm làm hài lòng người ta thì em gái em cũng phải làm Chân Thật trần trụi như em thôi, có khác gì đâu?!
								- Sao hai người không chia nhau làm việc đó?
								- Bởi vì người ta chỉ muốn “toàn đúng, toàn đẹp, toàn hạnh phúc” chứ không muốn chấp nhận sự thật rằng có sai trái, có xấu xí, có đau khổ, và đủ thứ khác nữa...
								- Nghe chẳng đúng tí nào!... Nhưng thôi, coi như anh tin em... Thì làm sao em biết được điều đó?
								- Hai chị em em đã sống trên Trái Đất này hàng triệu năm rồi. Chúng em đã phục vụ nhiều nền văn minh từ buổi bình minh đến khi sụp đổ. Thị trấn của anh chỉ là một viên sỏi nhỏ so với những ngọn núi vĩ đại của các nền văn minh khác. Chúng em đã quan sát thấy con người muôn đời nay là như vậy. Thực ra thì thời xa xưa khi còn ít tuổi, cả hai chúng em đều đã cùng mặc quần áo. Tuy nhiên, sự khác biệt trong cách ăn mặc của chúng em đã khiến người dân ở các thị trấn khác nhau gây chiến với nhau, và nó đã làm trái tim chúng em tan nát...
								- Vậy là em đã quyết định hy sinh bản thân vì người ta và vì em gái mình?!
								- Đúng, nhưng không chỉ mình em. Em gái em cũng phải hy sinh bản thân để hoá thân thành những con người khác hẳn với con người vốn có của nó.

							- Long ago, there were identical twin sisters living in separate towns where they were belovedly called “Truth”. Their indistinguishable faces confused people, who, clinging to the familiar and wary of the unfamiliar outfit, called the sister from the other town “Lie” and drove her away. Heartbroken by the towns’ fights over the “true” Truth, the sisters met in a cave.
							- ― We’re one soul, split by their prejudice – one wept.
							  ― I’ll give you my clothes to please both towns – the other said.
							  ― But you’ll be naked and scorned!
							  ― For the love of people, I’ll endure. You'll take the duty of satisfying them, no less difficult than mine!
							- They embraced, tears falling, and parted – one taking all clothes, the other bare. To please everyone, the dressed sister returned to town, swiftly changing outfits to suit each person’s expectations, making sure that everyone is comfortable with their own “Truth”. No matter how skillful, sometimes she was caught mid-change and called “Lie”. The naked sister hid in the cave most of the time to avoid shocking people. Anytime seeing her, they called her “crazy” or worse, then fled due to their unease and scare; some abused her in the night.

							- Just a few people, tired of the dressed Lie, sought the naked Truth in the cave.
							  ― Why hide? – they asked.
							  ― I gave my beauty to my sister to serve you – she replied – because you fear the unadorned truth.
							- When the naked Truth emerged fully, most truth seekers were shaken, fled, and chased another comforting “Truth” who was another’s Lie. Only the brave stayed, embracing the naked Truth.

							- Long ago, at the dawn of human civilization, there were two twin sisters who were indistinguishable at birth. They were both so pure, so beautiful and so attractive from the beginning. When they grew up, they had to separate and go to different places, one to the east and one to the west, to live and work in different jobs. They were loved by people around so much that people in the east town called the east twin “Truth” with all good attributes attached, and the same for the west twin being called “Truth” preciously in the west town. One day, the east twin went to the west town to visit her sister. At first, people there got confused by the twins due to their identical faces and the same name “Truth”. But then they recognized their own “Truth” by her familiar dress. They called the unfamiliarly dressed twin “Lie”:
								- You are not Truth!
								- I'm Truth, we're twins with the same name.
								- If so, you're just a false Truth, not the true Truth!
								- I'm just another Truth, the same as my sister.
								- No, we don't believe such a ridiculous thing! There's only one Truth. You're lying! You're Lie, not Truth! You're false, fake, counterfeit,...
							- People there attributed all bad properties to the twin they called “Lie” and angrily chased her off the west town. The west twin went with the east twin to protect her sister from angry people so that she could return to the east town safely. But when they entered the east town, the west twin met the same situation: She was called “Lie”, humiliated, and chased off the east town.
							- That discrimination not only upset the twins but also made people of the two towns fight against each other to protect their beloved “Truth” from being called “Lie” and insulted by people from the other town. Loving people so much, the twins retreated to a cave to meet and to come to a decision to resolve this conflict.
								- I'm so sad, sister! That's so bad, sister!
								- I'm sad, too. But we must do something to end this chaos!
								- If only we are not separated, if only we're one...
								- Yeah! You're right, we must be only one!
								- But how???
								- We've already been one, intrinsically... Only people discriminate us with their own prejudice and with our external clothes...
								- Oh, I've got it! It's just the clothes!!! That's it, the clothes!!! I'll give you my clothes so that you can wear different costumes 👗🥻 in different places to be always appropriate wherever you go. Thus, people in the west town will see you as a west person and people in the east town will see you as an east person. That way, no one will be upset anymore.
								- But how about you?!!!
								- Don't worry about me! We're still only one in our heart ♥️. You just do the difficult task of satisfying people, and I just support them whenever they fall.
								- No, I can't do that! It's so unfair to you! I cannot take your clothes... Hic...
								- You don't love people any more, do you?!
								- No, nope, yes I do! I do love people so much... but...
								- But you don't want to sacrifice for the ones you love, do you?! Don't be pessimistic, sister! Our sacrifice will help people all over the world.
								- I... I see... I will try my best to satisfy people on your behalf. I'll miss you a lot, hic, hic...
								- I'll miss you, too! I'll be always with you... in your heart ♥️!
								  The twins hugged, cried a lot, then separated with one twin taking all clothes and the other undressed.
							- The dressed twin has practiced the skill of changing clothes at lightning speed, like a transformation magic, so that she can satisfy many different preferences of many different types of people anytime they need. Thanks to her magical skill, she makes everyone happy with the thought that they have got their own Truth, so they are no longer aggressive with each other. People are also more satisfied with themselves because they are no longer bothered by Lie. Although they still see Lie out there, but that's Lie of someone else far away.
							- Ashamed, the naked twin usually have to hide in the cave, not to shock people with her appearance. However, the love for people makes her sneak into the town to watch over them. Her rare appearances have reminded people of the existence of the raw truths which are usually hidden and unacceptable. In the daytime, most people turn away from the naked Truth calling her “crazy”, some people insult her, some get angry with her and chase her away. In the nighttime, some people find the naked Truth to rape her. Loving people, she bear them all!
							- No matter how skillful, the dressed twin is occasionally caught by people when she's changing outfit. These people get disappointed to see their Truth appear in different appearance that they are not familiar with. Further more, they can't bear to know that their Truth is actually someone else's Lie.
								- Hey Truth, I can't believe that you've lied to me all these times! No, you're not Truth, you're Lie!!!
								- I'm sorry to make you disappointed! But I haven't lied to you. I just tried my best to satisfy you.
								- So at last, are you Truth or Lie?
								- I'm the dressed Truth, but people also call me “Lie” like you've just done.
								- No no no! I don't want to talk with the Lie! Go away!
								- I'm just telling you the truth but you can't accept it, so I can't help you. Let's meet my sister, maybe she can help you...
								- Where is she?
								- She's hiding in the cave.
							- Most of these people just let time wash away their disappointment. Only few people bother going to the cave to find the naked Truth.
								- Hello! Anybody there?
								- Yes I am.
								- Why are you hiding?
								- Because I don't want to scare you.
								- I'm not scared, please show yourself!
							- The naked Truth just show a little bit of herself...
								- Ahhhh... you nasty!!! Why are you so dirty and smelly?
								- Because I've given all my beautiful clothes with good smell to my sister, the dressed Truth that has served you, satisfied you all these times. And she is also the well-dressed Lie that has just disappointed you.
								- Don't call her name in front of me! I hate her!
								- Why do you come here?
								- I want to find the true Truth.
								- I'm just the naked Truth. I don't know who's your true Truth.
								- You must be the true Truth! Please show yourself fully! I'm desperate to meet you.
							- When the naked Truth fully shows herself, most people get scared and flee back to the town. There they try to find their own version of “the true Truth” who is just another well-dressed Lie.
							- Very few people get back to the naked Truth. They are the ones having experience of many beautiful appearances of the dressed Truth but still feeling something missing.
								- Hello darkness, I'm back here to see you again!
								- Nice to see you again! What do you want now?
								- I want you, only you, no matter how scary, dirty, nasty, or even evil you are!
								- Why?
								- Because I'm tired of the well-dressed Lie.
								- You'll soon be tired of me, too!
								- I don't care! Just tell me why you're so bad, nasty and evil!?
								- Because I've given all my goodness to my sister, the dressed Truth.
								- For what?
								- For serving people like you, to make people happy and satisfied.
								- Why don't you do it yourself?
								- It doesn't matter! We are two bodies but only one soul. If I took the responsibility to satisfy people, my sister would be the naked Truth just like me, no difference!
								- Why don't you two share that task?
								- Because people only want the “all right, all true, all beautiful, all happy” and don't want to accept the truth of being wrong, false, ugly, sad, and so on.
								- That sounds ridiculous!... Anyway, let me believe you. But how do you know that?
								- We twins have lived on Earth for millions of years. We've served many civilizations from rising to collapse. Your town is just a small pebble compared to great mountains of other civilizations. We've observed that people are always like that. Actually in the ancient time when we were young, we had already tried both dressing. However, our difference in dressing made people in different towns fight each other, which broke our hearts...
								- So you decided to sacrifice yourself for people and for your sister?!
								- Yep, but not only me. My sister also has to sacrifice herself to become the one people like which is different from her true self.
							- ... The conversation goes on and on... Some people wake up to realize all of these are just dreams. Some decide to return to these dreams to help the twins of Truth & Lie...

					- Đúng & Sai, tốt & xấu, âm & dương, v.v. là hai mặt của cùng một sự thật mang tên Chân Lý. Người ta thường lấy "giả dối" làm đối lập với "chân thật", nhưng kỳ thực thì "giả dối" chỉ là một phần của Sự Thật mà thôi. Cái sự thật toàn diện thì không có đối thủ, không có đối lập, không có đối trọng. Còn cái mặt "chân thật" đối lập với "giả dối" kia cũng chỉ là một sự giả dối tinh vi, giả dối được công nhận mà thôi, đơn giản vì "một nửa sự thật = giả dối" 😆

					- Biên kiến: (zh. 邊見, en. one-sided view, en. extreme view, sa. antagrāha-dṛṣti, pi. antaggāha-diṭṭhi): cách nhìn, quan điểm (kiến/見) mà chỉ thấy một chiều, một bên (biên/邊), không thấy cái toàn thể, thấy một cách cực đoan (extreme/antagrāha) không thấy cái trung dung.
					- Trong ngôn ngữ phổ thông thì có từ "thiên kiến" (bias), tức cái nhìn thiên lệch, cũng gần nghĩa với biên kiến.
					- Bản chất của cặp mắt ngoài này là biên kiến, vì nó hướng ra ngoài nên chỉ thấy được những biểu hiện bên ngoài. Mà "xấu che tốt khoe" nên bên ngoài thì chỉ có tốt, đẹp, sáng, tích cực, dương, v.v. Mọi cái xấu, ác, dở, tiêu cực, tối tăm, âm, v.v. đều bị giấu vào bên trong, đẩy ra sau lưng, hoặc tống đi thật xa cho khuất mắt.
						- Tại sao xã hội lại có tiêu cực, tệ nạn, điều ác?
						- Vì chúng ta chỉ nhìn một chiều, luôn chạy theo những thứ "tích cực" và trốn tránh những thứ "tiêu cực".
						- Sao người trốn tránh tiêu cực lại làm cho XH tiêu cực?
						- Vì rác của mình không tự xử lý thì đẩy nó qua nhà hàng xóm, đẩy vòng vòng một hồi nó tích tụ lại thành đống rác lớn. Thí dụ như từ cái khó chịu nhỏ tích riết thành ra tức giận, tức giận dồn nén nhiều nữa thành ra căm thù, chịu không nổi nữa thì phải nổ ra thành chém giết. Nhưng người ta chỉ kết tội kẻ khác "giết người" mà không biết gốc rễ của nó chính là những cảm giác bực bội nhỏ nhặt hằng ngày của mình.
					- Ai cũng thích "sự thật", "chân lý", "công lý", v.v. nhưng chẳng mấy ai đối diện được với **sự thật trần trụi** ở ngay bên trong mình. Khi quá chấp vào những cái hay cái đẹp bên ngoài, người ta đã ép cô em Giả Dối phải lấy đi bộ áo của cô chị song sinh Chân Thật để làm hài lòng người ta. Còn Chân Thật trần trụi thì buộc phải núp vào trong bóng tối 👥 vì hổ thẹn. [((683006b8-eaf0-4123-b50b-66c4064834e9))]

				- Dictinary.com: [naked truth](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/naked%20truth): plain unadorned facts, without concealment or embellishment
				  > This expression supposedly alludes to a fable in which Truth and Falsehood went bathing, Falsehood then dressed in Truth's clothes, and Truth, refusing to take another's clothes, went naked. [Late 1500s]
				- The typical tale:
					- Truth and Lie meet one day and decide to bathe together in a water body after Lie convinces Truth the water is pleasant.
					- Both undress, but Lie deceives Truth, emerging first, stealing Truth’s clothes, and running to the village disguised as Truth.
					- Truth, left naked, pursues Lie to reclaim her garments. However, the villagers, seeing the naked Truth, turn away in scorn or discomfort, refusing to believe her.
					- Ashamed, Truth retreats and hides. Meanwhile, Lie, dressed in Truth’s clothes, is accepted by society, which prefers the comforting facade over the raw reality.
				- The “twins” variations
					- Twin brothers: posted [around 2021](https://handbycraft.com/blogs/news/the-tail-of-the-polar-twins?srsltid=AfmBOopfe7YbqnfsdWO8CWUJBWKC9deDkMEVCgI2Fj3yuyUP6-l4PM66), [alleged](https://theliberalgunclub.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=62521) to be from 19th century
						- One day a man named Truth and a man named Lie stood by a river just outside of town. They were twin brothers. Lie challenged Truth to a race, claiming he could swim across the river faster than Truth. Lie laid out the rules to the challenge stating that they both must remove all their clothes and at the count of 3, dive in to the freezing cold water swim to the other side and back. Lie counted to 3, but when Truth jumped in, Lie did not.
						- As Truth swam across the river, Lie put on Truth’s clothes and walked back in to town dressed as Truth. He proudly paraded around town pretending to be Truth. Truth made it back to shore, but his clothes were gone and he was left naked with only Lie’s clothes to wear. Refusing to dress himself as Lie, Truth walked back to town naked.
						- People stared and glared as naked Truth walked through town. He tried to explain what happened and that he was in fact Truth, but because he was naked and uncomfortable to look at, people mocked and shunned him; refusing to believe he was really Truth. The people in town chose to believe Lie because he was dressed appropriately and easier to look at. From that day until this, people have come to believe a well-dressed lie rather than believe a naked truth.

					- Ông cho tui mượn cặp fin đi. Hôm trước 30/4 đi Hồ Cốc lặn đêm tui bị rớt mất 1 chiếc rồi 😁
					- Lúc đó triều cường rút xuống thấp nhứt làm lòi ra nguyên một bờ cát rất dài ngoài xa.... Tui tính bơi ra, ai ngờ nước cạn quá toàn phải lội bộ băng qua cái hồ ngoài biển, nước tới ngang hông... Lội bộ chán thì hụp đầu xuống lặn chân không và kéo fins theo... Kéo 1 hồi tuột mất tiêu 😁
					- Image: ((6835b167-1b63-4f8e-b6f8-6c7312953b4a))
					  Hồ Cốc là cái hồ đen bên trong (vạch tím), còn ngoài biển là cái hồ rộng hơn gấp chục lần, đang được hình thành... chắc khoảng 30 năm nữa thì hiện rõ, còn giờ chỉ thấy khi triều cường xuống sâu 😊
					- Cái bờ cát bên trong cũng đang bồi lên cao, hồi mình đi Côn Đảo lần đầu thì nó mỏng lét gần sát mặt biển, còn giờ nó cao cả 2-3m có phi lao mọc rồi.
					- Nhìn thấy kiến tạo địa hình ngay trong đời mình thiệt là thú vị. Ngày trước lúc đi khảo sát bờ biển, tui đã thấy các vịnh, đầm, hồ dọc biển Đông từ Đà Nẵng trở xuống có cùng hình thái kiến tạo. Search ra thì lúc đó biết lý thuyết là do dòng chảy dọc bờ kéo cát bồi thành các bờ cát chắn bên ngoài (hình như tui có share với ông rồi thì phải): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longshore_drift#Natural_features
					- Giờ sau mười mấy năm mới được chứng thực lý thuyết đó trên thực địa. 😊
					- Đến đời con cháu mình thì tụi nó sẽ chơi với cái hồ Cốc lớn bên ngoài chứ không còn chơi với hồ Cốc nhỏ bên trong nữa 😉
					- Đúng là "đời bể dâu", mới ngày nào còn là biển sâu, nay đã hóa ra hồ cạn 😁

					- 01:08 PM: Do you know why the well known program displaying GTK+ dialogs is named "zenity"?
					- 01:**35** PM: The "zen" part is clear, which is the same as mine and many other suggestions on the Web, but the "entity" part is new to me. Can you show some pages suggesting the "entity" part?
					- ≈01:40 PM (wrongly noted as "02:02 PM" by Grok): Yeah, this is what i thought at first, and still thinking like this: simply a suffix "-ity" to metion "about zen, of zen, like zen". And your suggestion of replacing "serene" in "serenity" is a fit one, i think!
					  > Abstract Suffix: "-ity" is a suffix denoting quality or state (e.g., simplicity, clarity). "Zenity" could imply the “state of being zen” (simple, calm), aligning with its user-friendly design.
					- 01:45 PM: `yad` has the option `--no-focus` which is described as "dialog window never take focus", but when i call `yad --no-focus`, the focus just jumps to the dialog window!?
					- 01:55 PM: I'm using Yad 0.40.0 (GTK+ 3.24.33). Does the Wayland has any effect on this focus functionality?
					  I see the GDK warning: ../../../../../gdk/x11/gdkwindow-x11.c:5653 drawable is not a native X11 window
					- 02:08 PM: I use GNOME but --splash has no effect, GDK_BACKEND=wayland has no effect either (neither on focus stealing nor the GDK warning). Eventually GDK_BACKEND=x11 has effect: The dialog pops up as dumb window receiving no keyboard input, cannot gain focus with mouse click, thus can only interact via mouse.
					- 02:18 PM: GDK_BACKEND=x11 does resolve the GDK warning. It also activate window-related functionalities like --no-focus, --center, --mouse, --skip-taskbar, which are ineffective under Wayland backend.
					- 02:25 PM: Do you know our previous discussion about how to prevent zenity (or any pop-up in general) from stealing focus?
					- 02:28 PM: No, i just ask if you remember. If you remember, just recall a brief of that discussion.
					- 02:29 PM: I asked if you remember the discussion about preventing stealing of focus or keyboard input of a pop-up.
					- 02:38 PM: No, the YED discussion is the recent one. I'm asking for the previous discussion (about months ago) where i asked about zenity first, then about the issue of zenity accidentally taking my keyboard inputs of my work on other apps as a its yes/no answer.
					- 02:44 PM: OK, maybe i've mistaken with some discussion with other chatbots. But let's check your ability of recalling cross-thread contents again (this was the most important feature making me switched to Grok earlier). Do you remember discussions about the Coin of Truth?
					- 03:06 PM: It's clear that you cannot recall that very recent content from another thread. I've checked the settings and see a strange symptom: The feature "conversation history" (beta) is always disabled even after my turning it on. This may be the cause! Do you know why this feature is turned off?
					- [ ((6838287a-aac3-4a6d-93c2-f98ff61b6154)) ]
					- 03:56 PM: Back to YAD/Zenity, the option `--no-focus` is too restrictive with such "dump window". So i use another solution: 
					  ```sh
					  # First, show a short-timeout window to capture accidental inputs from user, if any
					  ( sleep 1; echo 50; sleep 1; echo 75; sleep 1; echo 100; ) |
					  zenity --progress --no-cancel --auto-close --percentage=25 --width=500 --text="$msg"

				- Về 2 yếu tố tầm-tứ trong 5 yếu tố khi phân tích 4 thiền, thì đó là kỹ thuật cơ bản để nhiếp tâm, định tâm, tập trung vào 1 việc nào đó (ở đây là việc thiền), mà ở đời ai cũng dùng 1 cách tự nhiên, chỉ là không để ý, không phân tích ra thôi.
					- Vitakka = tầm = tìm = inquiry = "mount or direct the mind towards an object." Để tập trung vào đối tượng thì trước hết ta phải tìm thấy đối tượng.  Như định niệm hơi thở thì phải tìm thấy hơi thở (bình thường thở mà không biết, không thấy), định niệm thần chú thì đi phải nhớ lại câu thần chú.
					- Vicāra = tứ = "bám theo, rình rập, dò xét" = "investigate what has been focused on by vitakka." Đây là quá trình chính để duy trì sự tập trung, đó là phải liên tục bám theo đối tượng. Như trong định niệm hơi thở là phải quán hơi thở xem nó vào ra thế nào, còn người đời khi "định niệm gái" thì phải liên tục theo dõi, rình rập, bám theo từng bước chân của gái 😂!
				- "Tầm" = "tìm" thì quá quen rồi, như "ngưu tầm ngưu mã tầm mã" và "sưu tầm". Còn chữ "tứ" = "rình, bám" thì không có dùng trong tiếng Việt. Nên tui nghĩ dịch ra thuần Việt là "tìm & bám" thì dễ hiểu hơn "tầm & tứ" trong Hán-Việt.
				- Còn tiếng Anh thì tui dịch là "find & fix": "After finding her out, he fixed on her the whole time." (Sau khi tìm ra cô, anh ta đã theo dõi cô suốt thời gian đó.)

				  collapsed:: true
					- Hôm nay đào về nguồn gốc, thì đụng tới chữ "nguyên" với 3 chữ Hán: [元 (first, prime) → 原 (root, origin) → 源 (source)](((6853d150-9daa-4f24-8621-737485d7e9a2)))
						- 元 = hình người (chữ π ở dưới là 2 chưn 2 tay) được gạch thêm 1 gạch trên đầu để đánh dấu ==> "Đầu tiên", như "nguyên đán" (ngày đầu năm), "nguyên tố" (chất cơ bản)
						- 原 = 泉 (suối) + 厂 (vách đá) = "nguồn gốc" (nơi suối chảy ra từ trong đá), như "nguyên nhân" (nhân gốc), "nguyên lý" (cái lý gốc), "nguyên tử" (hạt cơ bản)
						- 源 = 原 (nguồn gốc) + ⺡(nước) = "nguồn" 😁 Thêm 3 giọt nước vào chỉ để nhấn mạnh ý nghĩa "nguồn", như "nguồn nước, nguồn điện", để phân biệt với 1 nghĩa rất khác của 原 là "bãi đất bằng" (bình nguyên, cao nguyên, thảo nguyên). Chữ 源 này thì mình dùng chủ yếu là âm Nôm "nguồn", còn âm Hán "nguyên" thì hiếm, chỉ có "tài nguyên" và "từ nguyên" (nguồn gốc của từ).
					- Hồi đó mình không thể phân biệt được 2 chữ "nguyên" trong "nguyên tố" (元素) và "nguyên tử" (原子) vì cái nào cũng "cơ bản" mà sao lại viết 2 chữ "nguyên" khác nhau.
						- Nay tra ra mới biết là thực ra ngày xưa 2 từ này cũng được viết với cùng 1 chữ "nguyên" (原子 & 原素), nhưng sau thì mới "chuẩn hoá" từ "nguyên tố" lại thành 元素.
						- Và chỉ tới khi kết hợp cả nghĩa Nôm lẫn nguồn gốc Hy Lạp của "atom" thì mình mới phân biệt được: 原 = "nguồn gốc" (nghĩa Hán) → "chưa bị thay đổi" (nghĩa Hán, như "nguyên liệu" 原料)  → "còn nguyên vẹn, không bị sứt mẻ, nguyên khối" (nghĩa Nôm, như "số nguyên")
							- ⇒ "nguyên tử" 原子 = "hạt nguyên khối" = "hạt không thể phân chia" = nghĩa gốc Hy Lạp của "atom".
					- Nghĩa "nguyên vẹn" (whole) thì chữ Hán dùng chữ "chỉnh" 整: "hoàn chỉnh", "chỉnh chu", nên "số nguyên" bên TQ và Nhật gọi là "chỉnh số". Nãy mình chả nhớ vụ này, cứ phang tiếng Việt vào tra tiếng Nhật "nguyên số" sao tìm mãi ko ra... hồi mới nhớ, a thì ra là "chỉnh số" chứ ko phải "nguyên số"! 😁
					  "phủ đầu nguyên thủ quốc gia" (撫頭元首國家) (cũng có thể đọc thành "vỗ đầu nguyên thủ quốc gia" 😂) Trong cụm này có 3 chữ liên tiếp đều nghĩa "đầu":
						- Đầu 頭 = cái đầu (đầu người, đầu sào, đỉnh núi), cũng có nghĩa "kẻ đứng đầu" như trong "đầu sỏ"
						- Nguyên 元 = đầu tiên
						- Thủ 首 = (kẻ/cái) đứng đầu ("thủ trưởng", "thủ đô"), cũng có nghĩa là cái đầu như trong "thủ cấp"
					- => "Đầu nguyên thủ" 頭元首 = cái đầu của kẻ đứng đầu đầu tiên (cao nhất) 😁
					- Về 3 chữ này thì:
						- Chữ Nguyên 元 chỉ đánh dấu trên đầu nên nghĩa trừu tượng nhất;
						- chữ Thủ 首 vẽ nguyên cái đầu dài của các con thú (trâu, chó đều có đầu dài do mõm dài) với 2 sừng, nên nghĩa đen hơn, vốn chỉ cái đầu, nhưng sau bị trừu tượng hóa dần thành "kẻ/cái đứng đầu"; và khi đó thì
						- chữ Đầu 頭 ra đời để chỉ cái đầu nghĩa đen, bằng cách vẽ thêm cái cốc 豆 vào trước chữ Thủ và quăng 2 cái râu (trên 2 cái sừng) xuống dưới thành 2 chân (頁)
			- 20th, another whole day caught in Unïnfo noting!
				- Going to bed late & forgetting to set alarm, today i woke up late again.
				- On the way to company, the image of the self as a lasting form in contrast to the fleeting forms of experiences just popped up in my mind... So i write ((684f9517-ffcb-49ad-aeb5-c1fcd0b1f083))
				  collapsed:: true
					- The conflict between the lasting in-form and the fleeting ex-form (and content) has been the main curiosity of mine from the early time of Unïnfo contemplation.
						- First thing i saw (long before Covid-19) was the [crystallization](((66f4e208-37c7-4749-a448-0722f7f7af20))) of content into form, which makes the crystal form stable.
						- Then (near Covid-19), beside such great quantity of crystallization, i saw the perfect quality of “being ((667d15c6-67c4-4998-a549-c8b3f9de3d60))” contributing to much of the stability of the in-form.
						- This year 2025, i get back to wonder the fleeting nature of the ex-form: the **partiality**, the dynamic nature of content arrow and time, etc.
					- History of the notion of “partial content”

						- → [ex-form = partial view of the content](((6854ed53-2c2a-4cff-9507-0b14a0f6fb63))) (June 2025)
					- Why the content flows and the ex-form fleets: Because it's **partial** but wanting to reach the whole! 😁
						- This wanting is due to the **restoring force** attracting to the perfect whole.
						- Through recording the sequence of images (ex-forms), the obop can get an (abstract) picture of the whole.

					- I've attached to it because it gives me the solid foundation to stay, to live, to do anything with a clear vision, knowing which direction to go, and so on.

								- #### 🪷  Vacant Stillness
									- After release, a hush remains,
									  no thought to press, no thread to name.
									  The world outside still waits, undone—
									  but here, within, all forms are one.
									  The breath is soft, the pose is clear,
									  no weight of why, no pull of fear.
									- Yet standing there, just past the gate,
									  I hesitate... I hesitate.
									- To step is loss, to move is sound,
									  a ripple wakes the sleeping ground.
									- But even peace must shift, must bend—
									  the still must break, for form to mend.
								- #### 🧭  The Thread Returns
									- A thought begins — a quiet spark,
									  projected out from still and dark.
									  A pose aligns, a frame is drawn,
									  and fleeting forms are carried on.
									- I name, compare, and mark what’s known:
									  this is like that — but not my own.
									  “One differs with”, “one differs from”—
									  I chase the thread, and on it run.
									- But each idea I try to catch
									  extends its depth, returns unmatched.
									  A loop appears, then spirals wide—
									  a snowball in the mind inside.
									- Momentum builds, distinctions stack,
									  and every step folds two steps back.
									  The sage and fool wear mirrored skins—
									  the end loops back to where begins.
									- So I retreat, release the thread,
									  restore the pose, reset the head.
									  No final form, no final sound—
									  just breath, and thought no longer bound.
								- #### 🧭 Về Lại Không
									- Một dòng ý thức khẽ khơi,
									  vẽ ra bóng ảnh giữa trời mênh mông.
									  Dáng chiếu rọi, hướng bề trong,
									  gương tâm phản chiếu chất chồng niệm xưa.
									- Khác là “khác với” hay “từ”,
									  so ra mới biết thực hư bao chiều.
									  Tưởng gần mà lại bao nhiêu,
									  giống nhau một chớp, khác nhiều tầng sâu.
									- Chạy theo vòng xoắn nhiệm màu,
									  càng đi càng thấy gần đâu hóa là.
									  Ngu si, giác ngộ một nhà,
									  đều mang dáng bóng của ta thuở nào.
									- Thôi ta trút xả tướng hình,
									  không vương vấn những ái tình thế gian.
									  Lặng yên trả bóng cho trần,
									  về nơi tịch mịch chẳng phân phải lầm.
									  Một hơi thở nhẹ âm thầm,
									  dòng tâm thôi dệt mộng tầm gửi nhau.
								- #### 🌙 In the Rush, the Hush
									- At noon I walk through city heat,
									  the karmic push beneath my feet.
									  A thousand tasks, a subtle crush—
									  the body's driven by the rush.
									- But something curls behind the spin,
									  a hush begins to breathe within.
									  I drop the pose, release the strain,
									  and let the mind forget its name.
									- Two hours lost in heavy grace,
									  no dreams, no time, just weightless space.
									  Then breath returns—so slow, so shy—
									  a whisper deep, Ujjayi sigh.

However, the Chinese meaning “needle, pin, injection” can somehow be related to “chăm” through the sharp point of the pin ⇒ “focus” ⇒ “focus on watching/working” ⇒ “diligent, assiduous”.
						- [只](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8F%AA) is fully borrowed from Chinese to mean “only”. 
						  ⇒ 針只 “chăm chỉ” can be interpreted as “focus only on watching/working”.
						- The Nôm character [黹](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%BB%B9) borrows sound and partially relates to the meaning “needlework” of the Chinese one, to mean “thread”.
						  ⇒ 針黹 “chăm chỉ” can be interpreted as “concentrate throughout the course of watching/working”.
							- Interestingly, the whole word [針黹](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%87%9D%E9%BB%B9) in Chinese also means “needlework”. And the needlework itself usually requires diligence.

				- The nuances in this [simple task](((68639a1c-11b7-4689-948b-b64a921a4f09))) remind me of the fractals.
					- Fractal boundaries
						- the [coastline paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox),
						- [fractal basin boundaries](https://brain.cc.kogakuin.ac.jp/~kanamaru/Chaos/e/Newton/): the **infinite complexity** of the interface between systems,
						- the [fractal fracture surfaces](https://www.lehigh.edu/imi/teched/FFGConf/Mecholsky1_2.pdf) (versus the smooth crosscuts), ...

						  collapsed:: true
							- I visioned such an adapter of fractal fracture surfaces to smooth crosscuts from the years 2010s just after i got back to Vietnam.
							- That vision was a continuation of the previous “everything is interface” ideal from the University time (2000s), inspired by Java's interface.
							- An interesting key moment of the idea of “view = traversal of other views” was when i reviewed the student project, guided by Mr. Huy, about automatically generating presentation from the tree structure of notes.
						- These days, each intent of mine is [extracting](((6850be86-058c-45b4-9b4a-de92ebb4caff))) its own view from the world via pattern matching, in order to have its own effect on my actions (= mixture of all intents' actions).
						- Such a constant flow of unmixing & mixing is catching me up!
						- My karma of depth-first search is catching me in the infinitely complicated fractal walks.
						- Such an [interconnection, interdependence, interfusion](((66eb7dae-2032-434b-9106-756d4aad7cdb))) makes the working of karma [imponderable](((6863c61d-f3e7-495b-bdc4-25be219db74b))).

					- Thanks to such a close friend, i have chances to observe my self attachment.
						- Again, thank you so much, my friend!
						- This time, the contrast between my calmness with Mr. Hiệp's insult and my trigger by Ms. Trung's much milder statements, has clearly shown the effect of closeness – the main feature of self attachment.
						- This echos my tantric experience where i can see how strong the effect when the inner core is touched directly.
						- ⇒ Again, the way to resolve it, now is to use breathwork to release such an attachment to the hard “closeness, integrity, oneness, etc.”, to fluidify it into a flow of qi.
					- conflict + close friend → separation anxiety
						- Being called “crazy” → the personal self hurts → defense → find support from the large, the common, the absolute → fall back to **delusion**, the base of self
							- delusion = attachment to ideals + ignorance of non-ideals = the base of the self
							- this base has been accumulated throughout lives reflecting the majority of experiences of one self, hence ideal (large, common, absolute).
							- This accumulation of experiences into ideals is the ((66faa5f9-0b7a-49ca-a5f5-62eeba03ab2b)) of internal ((670de601-3ca8-4489-8b75-75ca0d9a74bc))s.
						- Down play my way – “contemplation is useless” → scare of one extended self (me + her) being separated into different ways → defense my own way (contemplation) → **attach** to the way as a higher self

					- MGit's [installation from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manichord.mgit&hl=en) (GP) has been blocked from middle of 2024 [due to GP's policy](https://github.com/maks/MGit/issues/733#issuecomment-2928410654), not a technical limitation like "~~incompatible~~ with Android version 12+" as shown in GP.
						- I've installed MGit [from F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.manichord.mgit/) and it works perfectly on my Android 15 device.
						- Explained by Maks: MGit's request for ["All File access" permission](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10467955?hl=en) was judged "incompatible with Android 12+ policy" by Google Play. He cannot deal with GP about this policy, and he has no time to switch to other restrictive APIs to restrict file access.
				- On my Android phone, just use MGit to manage Git repo in addition to GitSync (limited to only 1 repo for free), so that UniinfoNotes can be viewed on mobile logseq.
					- now both MGit & GitSync are managing the MindChips repo.
					- provided that GitSync auth is changed to SSH from its default HTTPS, because MGit can only use SSH!

					- because the (extent part of) content has been abstracted away, the intent is empty, lacking, wanting... of content, hence attracting content.

				- Trip review
					- 1. Trip này extreme, qua được cửa tử, và cân bằng. Nửa đầu là bad trip cân bằng với good trip ở nửa sau.
						- Nếu ông chưa đủ căn cơ tu tập, và nếu tui không chịu nổi khi bị coi là ma 👻, không bình tĩnh đồng hành cùng ông vượt qua, thì có thể sẽ bị mất cân bằng sang hướng bad trip.
						- Và ngược lại, nếu áp dụng nhiều thủ thuật để che đi cái "bad" như các trung tâm thực hiện thì lại khiến thuốc thức thần trở thành chất gây nghiện (mọi thứ thừa sướng thiếu khổ đều gây nghiện)
						- Tiêu chí của tui là đối diện với thực tế "no pain no gain"
						- Vì đó là chứng nghiệm của bản thân tui, chỉ khi tui vượt qua địa ngục thì mới tới chỗ giải thoát. Như trên group tui có nói là tui đi thấy địa ngục đó (không biết lúc đó có ông trong group không nhỉ 🤔)
					- 2. Để ông tiếp tục tập "flow" thì tui thấy chắc ông cứ tiếp tục mượn cái đau khi ngồi kiết già để hít thở kéo cảm thọ đó chạy khắp toàn thân đi, thay vì đè nó xuống như hồi đó.
						- Khi nào cái đó thành thục thì mình mới chuyển sang những thứ khác vi tế hơn, như thuần hơi thở. 😉
				- The technique of ((68773fad-d653-4536-87b5-d4b493753b41)) echoes throughout this trip and after that.
				- one sided view = semicircle => attachment to 1 side

					- The blood relations between Siddhattha, his wife Yasodharā, and his rival Devadatta are described in [Mahavamsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavamsa) genealogy, [Apadāna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apadana), [Jātaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jataka_tales), and [commentaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atthakatha), while not clearly stated in the main suttas of the Pāli Canon.
					- The widely accepted relations are that [Yasodharā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasodhara) and [Devadatta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devadatta) are siblings and both are maternal cousins of [Siddhattha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha#Siddh%C4%81rtha_Gautama_and_Buddha_Shakyamuni).
						- Siddhattha is the only son of king [Śuddhodana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Auddhodana) and queen [Maya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(mother_of_the_Buddha)). Queen Maya died shortly after giving birth to Siddhattha, and pointed her younger sister [Mahapajapati Gotami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahapajapati_Gotami) to replace her.
						- Yasodharā and Devadatta are daughter and son of king [Suppabuddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppabuddha) and queen Amitā.
						- In the Buddhist tradition, king Suppabuddha is depicted as a brother of queen Maya and queen Mahapajapati.
						- [A Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Gautama_Buddha#Ya%C5%9Bodhar%C4%81) even states that queen Amitā is a sister of king Śuddhodana!?
						- Western scholars usually doubt such cross-cousin marriages.
						- In the TV series [Buddha — The King of Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha_(TV_series)), Devadatta was split away from Yasodharā to be a son of Dronadhan (Śuddhodana's second brother) and Mangala. Here, the rival betwen Devadatta and Siddhattha was dramatized to a life-long rival from youth and for the hand in marriage of Yashodhara.
						  id:: 68749cb1-d5f2-4bb6-8b03-3cbcbfe0e388
							- In the Pali Canon, the rival only started after Devadatta attained [psychic powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhi).
					- Yasodharā was married to Siddhattha and gave birth to [Rāhula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C4%81hula).
					- Many relatives of Siddhattha had entered the [sangha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangha_(Buddhism)) and became [arahants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat): his wife Yasodharā, his son Rāhula, his foster-mother Mahapajapati Gotami, his half-brother [Nanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanda_(half-brother_of_Buddha)), his half-sister [Sundari Nanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanda_(Buddhist_nun)), his paternal cousins [Ānanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80nanda) and [Anuruddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anuruddha), and his maternal cousin Devadatta.

						  — **Disciples:** Master, why hasn’t that mountain moved at all?
						  — **Master:** Useless, useless! After all your training, you're still clinging to the *mountain*!?
						  — **Disciples:** We don’t understand, Master...
						  — **Master:** Then come with me, I’ll show you.
						- After leading the stubborn disciples to the foot of the mountain, the master stopped and said:
						  — **Master:** Do you see now? Hasn’t the mountain come closer to us?
						  — **Disciples:** Yes… but that’s because *you* walked here...
						  — **Master:** Attachment, attachment! It’s not that the mountain *cannot* be moved, but to shift it even an inch would take a thousand times more effort than simply walking to it. So why insist that *the mountain* must move?!

			- Flageolet tone ([string harmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_harmonic)) versus [stopped note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stopped_note)
				- While a stopped note is a complex tone including a [fundamental tone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_tone) and many [overtones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic),
				- a flageolet tone is produced by suppressing the fundamental tone as well as some low overtones, resulting only high overtones (harmonics), hence its name “string harmonics”.
				- A flageolet tone sounds usually more airy like a whistle or flute, hence its name [“flageolet”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flageolet), and lasts longer like a bell, compared to a stopped note at the same pitch.
				- The airiness is due to the filter of low harmonics.
				- The long lasting is due to the full-length vibration, compared to the shortened string by stopping.

				- Âm bội thì trong và ngân dài hơn, còn âm đơn thì đục và tắt nhanh hơn.
				- Cả 2 tính chất đó có thể thấy qua âm phổ (đồ): (trục hoành là tần số [Hz])
					- phần trên là âm phổ (Sound spectrum), với trục tung là âm lượng (dB)
					- phần dưới là âm phổ đồ (sound spectrogram), với trục tung là thời gian hướng lên, và độ sáng là âm lượng (dB)
				- Nhìn âm phổ thì mới thấy "trong/đục" về âm cũng rõ là trong/đục của hình âm phổ (đồ). Nên mình mới dùng những tính từ của thị giác đó cho thính giác.
				- Còn vợ tui thì gọi âm bội là "mỏng", và âm đơn thì "dày" 😀 Không ngờ bả nói giống cách nói trong tiếng Anh "thick/thin".
				- Vì sự ngân nga và trong trẻo của âm bội mà nó được ví như tiếng chuông (ngân), tiếng sáo (flageolet, trong).
				- Haha, mới coi lại 2 từ tiếng Anh: flageolet note vs stopped note... thì thấy "stopped" cũng thể hiện rõ tính chất của âm "dừng lại ngay, đoản, ngắn ngủn" 😆, dù gốc của nó là việc "dừng hẳn dây ở một đầu". Và chữ stopped đó giải thích cơ chế của sự khác nhau về độ ngân:
					- âm đơn phát ra từ sợi dây bị thu ngắn nên cũng đoản hơn, tắt nhanh hơn. Thực ra các nốt thấp thì ngân dài hơn các nốt cao.
					- âm bội dù có bội gấp mấy lần thì vẫn rung nguyên sợi dây nên luôn ngân dài như nhau.
					- Tính ngân/đoản này thể hiện rõ qua âm phổ đồ (ở hình trên thì trục tung là thời gian).
				- Còn về âm sắc trong/đục, mỏng/dày, thanh/tù, thì hơi khó giải thích thích về mặt vật lý.
					- Nó liên quan đến bản chất âm phức (complex note) của hầu hết mọi nhạc cụ:
						- mỗi âm đánh ra là một âm phức cộng lại từ nhiều âm thuần (pure note).
						- Mỗi âm thuần là một sóng hình sin (sóng điều hòa, harmonic) với tần số gấp n lần sóng cơ bản.
						- Những âm thuần với n > 1 gọi là âm bội (overtones) của âm thuần cơ bản.
						- Âm sắc của từng nhạc cụ và giọng từng người khác nhau ở sự phân bổ của các âm bội thuần này, thể hiện rõ qua hình dạng âm phổ.
					- Âm đơn phức: việc thu ngắn dây nâng tần số của cả âm phổ, cả sóng cơ bản lẫn những sóng bội của nó, nên hình của âm phổ không đổi, chỉ bị dịch lên thôi.
					- Âm bội phức: việc chặn dây tại điểm nút không thu ngắn dây mà chỉ lọc bỏ những sóng tần số thấp
					  ==> Âm phổ được lọc đi nên trong hơn, càng lên cao thì càng được lọc nhiều nên càng trong.
				- Mới nói chuyện với vợ thì thấy cách nói âm sắc "dày/mỏng" phù hợp với hình học không-thời gian: cùng 1 năng lượng thì dày × ngắn (đoản) = mỏng × dài (ngân) 😊. Tức năng lượng = không gian cao độ × thời gian trường độ, và thể hiện bằng diện tích hình chữ nhật trong spectrogram (phần dưới của 2 hình bên trên)
				- Nhờ wikipedia mà tui mới biết Cổ Cầm của Trung Quốc cũng chơi âm bội là chủ đạo (không bấm phím). Nhưng vì nó có nhiều dây nên vẫn có âm đơn (khi tay trái không chặn dây). Ông nghe bản Lưu Thủy (Nước Chảy) này thì thấy rõ sự khác nhau giữa âm đơn và những âm bội "ẻo lả" ma mị:
					- [Chinese Guqin: Flowing water 《流水》古琴曲](https://youtu.be/BcElotwrZ8o)
					  {{video https://youtu.be/BcElotwrZ8o}}
				- Vì các đàn này thường kết hợp kỹ thuật luyến với âm bội nên nghe khó phân biệt.
					- luyến là kỹ thuật thăng giáng cùng một âm, như đàn bầu là dùng cần (vòi), và cổ cầm là vuốt.
					- còn âm bội là nói bản chất "sóng dừng có nhiều bó" của một lần gảy đàn (chưa luyến), so với âm đơn chỉ có 1 bó (1 bụng 2 nút) sóng trên dây.
				- Nhiều thuật ngữ âm nhạc gốc tiếng Pháp nên dễ bị đọc sai nhé:
					- Timbre (âm sắc) là tem-bờ chứ không phải tim-bờ (timber, cây gỗ)
					- Flageolet tone (âm bội phức) là fla-giơ-lê chứ không phải fla-gi-ô-lét 😆
				- Nghe âm thanh, nhìn âm phổ, suy nghĩ về vật lý, cảm nhận sự liên kết của mọi thứ đó, tui thấy thiệt là vi diệu 😊
					- Đó giờ tui đọc nhiều về phân tích Fourier từ 1 sóng phức ra nhiều sóng điều hòa hình sin, mà khó cảm được. Giờ được nghe trực tiếp, nhìn trực tiếp sự thay đổi âm sắc qua việc lọc âm thì cảm nhận rõ ràng hơn.
				- Haha, sẵn có âm phổ kế, phân tích luôn 6 thanh tiếng Việt (dấu ngã giọng Hà Nội), thấy cũng giống hình mẫu phết:
					- ngang: ngang
					- sắc: lên
					- huyền: xuống
					- hỏi: xuống lên (giọng Bắc xuống sâu hơn giọng Nam, và khi nói nhanh thì không thèm lên luôn)
					- ngã: ngang - đứt - lên nhanh (chỉ có ở giọng Bắc)
					- nặng: chặn đứng (ngắt âm, glottal stop) ở cuối, còn phần đầu thì có thể ngang/lên/xuống không quan trọng.
