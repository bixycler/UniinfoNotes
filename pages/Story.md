					- Incongruity Theory:
					  id:: 677e2ce9-2ac6-4763-a9f0-ffb37bd7cdca
						- Definition: This theory suggests that humor arises when there is a disconnect or incongruity between what is expected and what actually occurs. The more serious or unexpected the context, the greater the contrast, and the funnier it becomes.
						- Paradox of Seriousness and Laughter: The seriousness of the initial situation heightens the incongruity when something funny happens, leading to more intense laughter. This intensification occurs both for the person who starts laughing and for those around them.
						- Example:
						  Imagine someone giving a very serious and formal speech, and suddenly something humorous happens, like a loud, unexpected noise. The stark contrast between the serious tone and the unexpected humor can cause an uncontrollable, infectious wave of laughter.
