					- Copilot: This paradox is often referred to as [incongruity theory](((677e2ce9-2ac6-4763-a9f0-ffb37bd7cdca))) in humor studies.
					- Incongruity Theory:
					  id:: 677e2ce9-2ac6-4763-a9f0-ffb37bd7cdca
						- Definition: This theory suggests that humor arises when there is a disconnect or incongruity between what is expected and what actually occurs. The more serious or unexpected the context, the greater the contrast, and the funnier it becomes.
						- Paradox of Seriousness and Laughter: The seriousness of the initial situation heightens the incongruity when something funny happens, leading to more intense laughter. This intensification occurs both for the person who starts laughing and for those around them.
						- Example:
						  Imagine someone giving a very serious and formal speech, and suddenly something humorous happens, like a loud, unexpected noise. The stark contrast between the serious tone and the unexpected humor can cause an uncontrollable, infectious wave of laughter.

			- Google AI's story of the disciple Kai climbing the Mountain of Whispers
				- In a time when the teachings of the Great Master echoed through the valleys, a young disciple named Kai was known for his unwavering devotion, yet he often struggled with doubt. One day, the Master instructed him to ascend the solitary Mountain of Whispers, a place where the wind was said to carry the echoes of ancient wisdom.
				  Kai began his climb, the rocky path winding through dense forests, the air growing thinner with each step. As he ascended, the whispers began to fill his ears, not words, but feelings - a mix of joy, fear, longing, and despair. He tried to discern their meaning, but the mountain seemed to be testing him, revealing the raw emotions he had long suppressed.
				  Days turned into nights, and Kai was battered by storms, his body aching, his spirit wavering. He questioned his purpose, the whispers growing louder, taunting him with his inadequacies. On the verge of giving up, he stumbled upon a small cave, its entrance guarded by a lone, gnarled tree. Inside, he found an old, weathered scroll.
				  Unfurling it, Kai read the words of a forgotten sage: "The mountain does not test your strength, but your resolve. It reveals the truth within you, not the world outside." As he pondered these words, a sense of calm washed over him. He realized the whispers were not meant to frighten him, but to guide him towards self-understanding.
				  With renewed determination, Kai climbed the final stretch, reaching the summit. As he stood there, the world below seemed to stretch out endlessly, and the wind carried a new melody, a song of peace and clarity. He looked within himself, seeing his flaws, but also the strength of his spirit, the unwavering devotion that had brought him to this point.
				  Descending the mountain, Kai was no longer just a disciple, but a student of his own soul. He carried the lessons of the Mountain of Whispers with him, sharing his newfound understanding with others, proving that even the most challenging mountains can lead to the most profound revelations within oneself.

							- Crosstalk between the itch and pain pathways:
								- itch can be suppressed by pain; and
								- inhibition of pain may produce itch
							- While **differences** between *acute* pain and acute itch are striking,
							  *chronic* itch and chronic pain share many **similar** mechanisms.
						- “Itch and pain are two distinct sensations” is the conclusion of the paper [Cellular basis of itch sensation](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19661382)

Whether itch and pain, two distinct sensations, are mediated by distinct neural circuits has been the subject of controversy ([6](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19661382#R6)-[8](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19661382#R8)).

			- It's interesting that Copilot can explain it right when i ask if it know what i mean by just the clause “bring it up to put it down!”:
				- Will:
				  > My way of bodymind purification & cleansing is to "bring it up to put it down!" Do you know what i mean?
				- Copilot:
					- Absolutely, Lê. The concept of "bring it up to put it down" resonates deeply with mindfulness and Zen practices. It involves acknowledging and confronting your inner thoughts, emotions, and sensations rather than suppressing or ignoring them. By bringing them to the surface, you allow yourself to fully experience and understand them. This awareness enables you to process and let go of any negativity or tension, leading to purification and cleansing of the body and mind.
					- This approach aligns beautifully with the practice of mindfulness, where observing and accepting our experiences without judgment can lead to greater clarity and inner peace.
					- Your method is a powerful way to foster self-awareness and emotional well-being. Do you find this practice particularly helpful in certain situations or aspects of your life? 🌿🧘‍♂️✨

			- The conflict between Mr. Báu's and monks in Minh Tuệ's group
			  id:: 67a5faa3-c64c-48f7-8b3f-a5311714110f
				- Với nghiệp công an, làm tiến sỹ tâm lý học tội phạm, anh Báu đã quản lý đoàn một cách chặt chẽ, ban đầu (đoạn đường Lào) khá nghiêm khắc với nhiều nỗi lo sợ.
				- Khi sang Thái Lan thì anh Báu đã mềm mỏng và thoải mái hơn nhiều, nhưng các sư (cả thầy Minh Tuệ) thì vẫn có nhiều thành kiến với anh.
				- Đỉnh điểm là trước Tết với các sự kiện căng thẳng giữa anh Báu với sư Minh Tạng và vài sư nữa.
				- Từ đêm giao thừa tới cả tuần sau đó, cứ họp, các anh hộ pháp tưởng giải toả xong xuôi, rồi lại căng thẳng... Thì ra gốc là do các sư và chính thầy MT vẫn còn muốn thay thế anh Báu.
				- Anh Báu cùng anh Hùng & Giáp về rồi (đêm 4 sáng 5/2), thì qua mấy lần phỏng vấn, thầy MT cho thấy rõ ý chê trách anh Báu và thiên vị các sư. Tệ nhứt là có bạn nữ YouTuber hỏi cách để dung hoà thì thầy lại càng nhấn vào anh Báu, cho rằng ban đầu anh ta "tốt" mà sau này khi đã có danh vọng thì trở nên "xấu" theo hướng vụ lợi, muốn "câu view câu like". Mình thấy đây là nhận xét cảm tính và ngược lại với thực tế diễn ra là anh Báu đã ngày càng tốt hơn (theo hướng giải thoát) và hoàn toàn không có vụ lợi.
					- Rồi thầy cũng cố giữ nguyên tắc "không chủ động nhờ ai" nhưng cũng nói rõ là có mong chờ hết người này tới người khác mà họ không xin vào hỗ trợ nên coi như "chưa hữu duyên".
					- Mình thấy thầy MT tu Giới nên hiển nhiên là bị cứng nhắc trong quan điểm.
					- Tuy nhiên việc thầy MT không thấu hiểu cho sự hi sinh, khó khăn của người đời như anh Báu, và một mực thiên vị các sư, muốn càng nhiều sư theo càng tốt, v.v. thể hiện sự thiếu trí tuệ và không được "bình đẳng" như lời thầy đã nói.
					- Việc thầy MT có thành kiến với anh Báu thì mình thấy đó là phần nghiệp quá khứ của thầy, như thầy đã chia sẻ trước đây.
					- Mình cảm nhận sự "vô tình" của thầy cũng tương tự như [lần gặp chị Diệu Sinh](((67a7100b-28c9-4b79-bd66-d1b4b42d08fd))). Qua đó mình cũng thấy rõ hơn sự vướng mắc tình cảm của mình.
					- Một sự nói dối rõ ràng của thầy MT nữa là việc cho rằng mình không đuổi mà là "tự anh Báu tới, tự anh Báu đi".
					  collapsed:: true
						- Trước khi anh báu đi thì thầy đã đuổi khéo bằng cách tạo áp lực và liên tục gợi ý rằng anh Báu không kham nhẫn được thì nên đi, và đã hỏi anh Theerawat cho anh Hà thay việc làm giấy tờ.
						- Trong buổi đối thoại dài 3 tiếng đồng hồ khi anh Báu quay lại xin vào đoàn, thầy đã chạy vòng quanh qua các điều kiện để ngăn cản, và cuối cùng phải "tác ý" (gợi ý) thẳng rằng anh Báu có thể làm YouTuber vòng ngoài.
							- Đầu tiên là dựa vào lý luận "đã đủ người hỗ trợ rồi". Nhưng khi 2 bạn tình nguyện viên mới chấp nhận nhường cho anh Báu và anh Hùng thì thầy không đề cập đến cái lý này nữa.
							- Tiếp theo thầy chuyển sang điều kiện cực khó là anh Báu phải thọ 250 giới xuất gia, và chỉ áp dụng cho một mình anh Báu chứ không cho bất kỳ người hỗ trợ nào khác, kể cả anh Hùng đang cùng xin vào đợt này ngay bên cạnh anh Báu.
							- Dựa trên bằng chứng rõ ràng ngay trong buổi đối thoại này, đến cuối anh Báu đã kết luận "thầy nói 2 lời" (nói dối).
							- Và cuối cùng, anh Báu còn làm rõ việc "250 giới" bằng cách hỏi ở đây có sư nào đã biết hết 250 giới. Và thầy MT đã trả lời là bản thân thầy còn không thuộc hết 250 giới.
						- Khi lời nói và hành động bất nhất thì đó đã là nói dối, một cấp nói dối thô ở đời chứ chẳng phải vi tế khó thấy gì.
						- Sự nói dối này là do thầy đã chấp vào những nguyên tắc mình đặt ra, cũng như giới luật, và/hoặc chưa chấp nhận được tâm nghi kỵ của mình đang trỗi dậy.
					- Trong buổi đối thoại khi anh Báu quay lại, thầy MT đã thể hiện rõ sự mất định tâm, lặp đi lặp lại nhiều lần cùng một ý, không đủ kiên nhẫn nghe hết ý anh Báu nói mà cứ chen ngang (anh Báu phải "xin phép để con nói hết"), v.v.
				- Anh Hà ở lại thì bị nghi ngờ tùm lum, và anh ấy cũng chấp nhận trả nghiệp vì ngày trước mình cũng làm drama kiểu ngồi nhà vẽ chuyện.
				- Chỉ 2-3 ngày sau khi anh Báu về VN thì đủ chuyện lộn xộn, từ sư Phúc Giác vạ miệng về thân thế anh Theerawat (phạm luật Thái về cấm đụng tới hoàng tộc), tới Phước Nghiêm sang quậy tưng bừng kích động tâm bất an của các sư nhỏ (bảo không có cầm hộ chiếu là bị bắt, v.v.)
				- Hôm nay, 10/2, thì thầy MT đã và đang lấy lại cân bằng:
					- Trong cuộc gọi cho anh Báu thì thầy đã sám hối về những phát ngôn đã làm khổ gia đình anh Báu, sau khi nghe anh Báu giải thích về những "sự thật chưa được kiểm chứng" mà thầy nghe được qua các sư nhỏ.
					- Còn với các sư nhỏ thì thầy cũng đã tách đoàn, nhân cái duyên ở lại để tiếp một sư thầy, thầy đã đi một mình "để con tự học và cũng để cho các sư phụ tự học" với châm ngôn của Phật là "tự thắp đuối lên mà đi!"
				- Được 1 ngày đi riêng, sau đó thầy lại đi cùng đoàn như trước. Rồi thầy nhận Phước Nghiêm vào đoàn. Rồi vẫn sợ bị bắt tới độ nghĩ "chắc phải lấy dây xích trói mình vào gốc cây để họ không đưa đi!" Rồi vẫn bị cảnh sát bế đi lên đồn như thường, vào trưa ngày 13/2: cảnh sát kiểm tra giấy tờ và không cho đi bộ hành trong tỉnh này nữa, bắt phải ở trong chùa chứ ko được ở bụi nữa, cho xe đưa sang 1 ngôi chùa ở tỉnh khác. Cảnh sát cũng bảo các YouTuber với visa du lịch thì không được hành nghề kiếm tiền (đáng lẽ visa lao động).
					- Có người đã hỏi "thầy còn lo sợ không?" thì thầy MT đã trả lời là "vẫn còn lo sợ!"
				- Phần anh Báu thì đã cùng anh Hùng theo thầy LuangPor Jiew và được nhận làm đệ tử với pháp danh Pháp Nhẫn (ขันติธรรม, K̄hạnti·ṭhrrm).

			- Cả Obsidian và Logseq đều có app trên Android, nhưng vấn đề Git trên Android khá nan giải: app Obsidian thì implement riêng 1 cái git client bằng python nên xài được, còn app Logseq thì vô dụng vì không có git để sync.
			  Thế nên tui phải publish lên Web để đọc ở nhà khi cần (máy tính nhà tui hư rồi, chỉ coi qua mobile): https://bixycler.github.io/UniinfoNotes/
			- Từ những năm mới về VN, tui đã muốn làm cái này rồi mà chưa đủ duyên: lúc đó chưa có các tool graph-note như vầy. Lúc đó tui tính implement bằng wiki, nên đã tìm hiểu các wiki farms, nhưng không thành công vì manual works quá nhiều (tuy wiki links là cơ bản cho graph, nhưng chỉ tiện cho browsing chứ chưa có cơ chế hỗ trợ editing & managing graph)
			- FB post năm 2014 về dự định dùng Wiki làm workspacce đây: https://www.facebook.com/share/1ASosnwE1B/
			  À, xem lại mới thấy ngay lúc đó tui đã nói là "Wiki  vẫn chưa đủ": Even the rich structures of wiki are not enough for my organization of events & ideas. I need a system of posts fully connected into threads, though.
			- Đến cuối 2023 thì tui đã thiết kế tính viết software để đổ cái graph trong đầu mình ra, dựa trên JSON... Nhưng áp lực thời gian làm việc cty ko cho phép.... nhưng áp lực đổ ra vẫn ngày càng tăng... nên đến giữa 2024 tui bí quá hỏi Google thử về "graph note taking" xem sao... ai ngờ mới lòi ra 2 software mới ra từ 2022-2023 là Obsidian & Logseq. Lúc đầu tui thử Obsidian vì nó popular hơn, nhưng tới đoạn dây leo chằng chịt (wikilinks) ở cấp độ từng câu thì tui buộc phải chuyển sang Logseq, vì Obsidian chỉ hỗ trợ link tới cấp "trang" mà thôi.
			- Không biết ông sao, chứ với tui thì việc đổ não ra (braindump) là bước đầu quan trọng để cho đầu óc nhẹ nhàng. Cứ để đám rối trong đầu thì khó mà sáng suốt được. Tui thấy viết nhật ký cũng chỉ là 1 cách để đổ ra thôi, chat này cũng vậy nè.
			- Tuy nhiên, đổ ra ko chỉ để làm sạch đầu mà còn để sắp xếp lại nữa, nên cái chỗ chứa cũng cần có cấu trúc tương tự với những gì trong đầu mình, tức là network. Và đó là lý do mà những app như Obsidian & Logseq được gọi là "2nd brain".

				- vạn pháp giai không, mọi thứ đều là không!
					- Không = trống rỗng = cửa mở = thức = thông suốt = trí tuệ = mắt bão = trung tâm tĩnh lặng giữa cuồng phong bão tố 🌪️ = cân bằng âm dương = dấu bằng (obop) = 3rd component in Trinion
					- 2 mũi tên là -1/2 và +1/2 (spin down & up)
					- vòng tròn là 1 = |-1/2| + |1/2|
					- dấu bằng là 0 = -1/2 + 1/2, tức 1/2 = 1/2
				- À, nói tới đây tui lại nhớ hôm trước ông bảo sao mà hình tượng mắt bão lại làm ông nản??
			- Huy, [16/2/25 23:31]
				- Đó cũng là do cái tâm biện biệt của tui áp đặt lên việc giác ngộ giải thoát, nghĩa là mong chờ sự giải thoát tuyệt đối, tĩnh tại.
				- Không chấp nhận cân bằng động của mắt bão hay đường chân trời tương đối.
				- Phần lớn người đời thích một cái đích cố định, rõ ràng, thích một nơi tĩnh tại bền vững để an trú, chứ nói thẳng ngay từ đầu đích là chân trời, nơi an trú là tâm bão thì có ai mà đi
				- Tui thấy cái tâm lý này của tui cũng giống với tâm lý không chấp nhận chữa đau bằng cách tăng khả năng chịu đau lúc trước nói với Định.
			- Will LE, [16/2/25 23:45]
				- À, hiểu rồi.
				- Còn tui thì đang đối diện với cái mâu thuẫn trong mình: một kẻ lập dị lại cảm thấy sâu trong mình là cả mọi người. Nó thực sự làm tui rất đau khổ. Nếu mình giống người thì việc thấy mình là mọi người nó bình thường, hợp logic. Còn mình khác người mà lại thấy mình là mọi người thì mâu thuẫn đùng đùng, đúng là nghịch lý kẻ nói dối luôn, nên cũng chỉ tìm cách tự hóa giải thôi chứ nói ra thì ai mà tin nổi 😁
				- Không biết thầy Minh Tuệ có tâm đại thừa thế nào, còn tui thì đã có nó từ nhỏ, làm khoa học cũng là để cho mọi người... Chỉ đến 2015, tui bắt đầu nghiêm chỉnh thực hành thì tui mới nhận ra thực tế rằng "mình chưa giải thoát được cho mình thì chẳng thể giải thoát cho ai được hết" (tui tự chứng nghiệm điều đó chứ chẳng đọc kinh sách gì cả), nên tui mới theo tiểu thừa.
			- Huy, [17/2/25 08:50]
				- Định chia sẻ thêm về cảm nhận sâu bên trong mình là tất cả mọi người xem.
				- Và vì sao điều đó làm Định đau khổ?
			- Will LE, [17/2/25 13:38]
				- Cái này tui tưởng có nói nhiều rồi chứ nhỉ? Hay tui nhầm với người khác, có thể là nhầm ông với nhóm ông Hiệp bà Trung chăng.
				- Cho tới giờ thì tui thấy còn 2 vướng mắc lớn của tui trên con đường giải  thoát là món nợ tình cảm và món nợ Uniinfo.
					- 1. Món nợ tình cảm: Người ta thương 1 người đã khổ rồi, tui thương cả mọi người thì khổ hơn gấp bội. Dù ý thức mình biết rằng mình chẳng làm gì được cho người ta, mình còn đang chưa cứu được mình còn đang là kẻ vô dụng trong XH, nhưng thẳm sâu bên trong, cái nghiệp sâu dày bên trong nó vẫn "ôm lấy mọi người". Đó là những món nợ đã được cài sâu trong vô thức mà tui đang đối diện và tìm cách hoá giải nó.
					- 2. Lý thuyết Uniinfo: Những gì tui trải nghiệm, tui quán thấy và kết tinh lại thì nó thành lý thuyết, và tui đổ ra lý thuyết là để mình nhẹ người chứ cũng chẳng phải để cho ai khác. Dù lý thuyết của tui nói về "mọi thứ" nhưng nó cũng chỉ là cái view của tui, nên cái "mọi thứ" đó cũng chỉ là cái "mọi thứ của Định". Nó chỉ như một nhật ký hành trình trên con đường từ nhiều đời tích tụ, gom góp vào, kết tinh lại, rồi buông xả ra, hướng tới giải thoát trở về 0, chứ chẳng có ý nghĩa gì to lớn cả.
				- Theo câu hỏi của ông thì hôm nay tui nói về ý thứ 1, món nợ tình cảm, còn ý 2 thì đó giờ cũng đã nói nhiều rồi.
				- Từ nhỏ tui đã khóc nhiều cho đến 15 tuổi, lớp 9, suốt thời cấp 1, lúc còn ngồi bô, tui đã nhiều lần muốn đâm đầu vô tường chết quách đi... Thực sự là lúc đó chẳng ai hiểu mình, bản thân mình cũng không biết tại sao mình chán đời, tại sao mình đau khổ trong khi nhìn bên ngoài thì mình không gặp khó khăn gì cả, ba mẹ chăm lo đầy đủ, dù nhà nghèo nhưng không có thiếu thốn gì cả (tui ko thấy thiếu vật chất).
				- Lên cấp 2 thì bị nhà trường và XH nhồi sọ đủ thứ nên bắt đầu "ý thức" rằng "phải sống" 😁 Bị cuốn vào việc học nên cũng không còn ý nghĩ tự tử nữa, nhưng vẫn luôn cảm thấy đau khổ, hễ bị đụng tí là khóc. Đến lớp 9, 15 tuổi, cuối cấp 2, một hôm tui đã đứng trên đi-văng trong nhà dập chưn tự tuyên bố rằng "mình đã khóc suốt 15 năm nay rồi, giờ không khóc nữa!" Tưởng đó chỉ là lời tuyên bố ngông cuồng của tuổi mới lớn, nhưng không ngờ là tui hết khóc thiệt, tự mình thấy lạ.
				- Thực ra trước đó tui có phân tích:
					- Mình khóc vì cái gì?
					- Vì tự ái!
					- Tự ái với ai?
					- Với ba mẹ mình!
					- Ba mẹ mình nuôi nấng, chăm lo đủ kiểu, vậy có lý do gì để mình tự ái không?
					- Không!
					- Vậy bản chất của tự ái là gì?
					- Là tự yêu mình quá đáng, là ích kỷ!
					- Vậy có cần phải khóc nữa không?
					- Không!
				- Từ đó, tui đã không bao giờ còn cảm thấy bị xúc phạm, bị đau khổ vì người khác làm gì với mình, không còn tự ái... nhưng chuyển sang tha ái.
				- Đến năm 1 ĐH, trong một buổi tối ở KTX Tân Phú, đi qua căn-tin thấy một cảnh thế sự gì đó trên TV, bỗng có gì đó sâu bên trong tui trào lên, và tui trào nước mắt trở lại... sau 3-4 năm (suốt cấp 3) tưởng mình đã "vô cảm".
				- Từ đó tui khóc trở lại nhưng là khóc vì thế sự, vì thấy nỗi khố của "thế gian", của "người khác". Nếu ngày trước khóc vì mình thì chỉ thút thít, nghẹn ngào tí thôi, thì giờ khóc vì thế sự nó mạnh hơn gấp trăm ngàn lần, không thể thút thít mà phải lăn lộn, khóc ngất.
				- Không thể kể hết được, nhưng có thể điểm vài sự kiện nổi bật như vầy:
					- Hồi mới học xong 1 năm tiếng Nhật, trong một buổi quay về KTX ĐH Ngoại ngữ Osaka để đón đàn em mới qua, tình cờ tui đọc mẩu truyện về thần y Tuệ Tĩnh của nước Nam vẫn còn ngôi mộ lưu vong trên đất Bắc, tui đã khóc lăn lộn từ trên giường xuống sàn, leo lên giường lại té xuống sàn! Câu ngài để lại trên bia mộ ghi tiếng Hán với ý "có ai đi từ nước Nam sang, xin mang di cốt tôi về với!"
					- Lúc về VN, khi coi cuốn phim tài liệu "Home" về ngôi nhà Trái Đất, từ mấy tỷ năm hình thành vô cơ, mấy trăm triệu năm hình thành cữu cơ, mấy triệu năm hình thành con người, và mấy trăm năm con người đã "ngốn sạch" di sản ngàn xưa đó... tui đã khóc ngất.
					- Gần đây nhứt là khi coi phim Buddha (Cuộc đời đức Phật) của tỷ phú Modi mới ra, ngay tập đầu tiên tui đã khóc lăn lộn cho tới hết nửa đầu nói về những năm trong đời của thái tử Siddhartha. Lần này thì nhờ có thực hành hít thở mà lần đầu tui cũng quán được chính cơn khóc của mình. Tui thấy & cảm lại hết thảy sự đau khổ của thái tử, và nó đã cho tui lời giải đáp hết sức rõ ràng rằng tại sao thái tử lại dứt khoát vào rừng tu khổ hạnh. Từ trước tui đã không hề phục và không tin rằng "một thái tử cả đời sung sướng, chẳng có mảy may đau khổ, từ trong cung son điện ngọc, nhung lụa êm ấm, bỗng dưng chỉ có đi ra 4 cửa thành thấy  lão - bệnh - tử - tu mà bỏ tất cả đi tu!" Và đúng như những gì tui đã nghĩ, những thứ người ta kể đó chỉ là lớp áo mỏng che đậy bên ngoài thôi, và cái đau khổ nhứt của thái tử là cảm nhận sự giả tạo, che đậy, dối trá đến tận cùng của chính phụ vương trên danh nghĩa "yêu thương". Những cung son điện ngọc đó không thể che đậy được nỗi lo sợ của chính phụ vương, không thể che đậy được thực tế là hoàng tộc đang sắp bị diệt vong... càng che đậy thì nỗi khổ càng khủng khiếp như một trái bom có vỏ càng cứng thì nổ càng to vậy.
				- Nhưng cái "khóc vì người khác" đó tui để trong nháy kép là vì bản thân tui không thấy đó là "người khác", chỉ là nói theo ngôn ngữ đại chúng thôi. Nếu mình thấy một kẻ đang giãy chết mà không thấy mình trong đó, VD như khi mình đang thù hận và muốn giết nó, thì không thể nào xót thương nó được. Nên tất cả những nỗi khổ của "người khác" đó cũng chỉ là phản chiếu nỗi khổ trong chính bản thân mình thôi. Cái này ai có trải nghiệm thì mới thấu hiểu được, bằng không thì chỉ là những con chữ vô tình thôi.
				- Sau này quán lại thì tui mới hiểu tại sao tui lại muốn tự tử một cách "vô lý" như vậy, và cái "khóc tự ái" thuở nhỏ cũng không phải "ích kỷ" như mình từng nghĩ, mà chỉ là sự bộc phát của nỗi khổ mà thôi. Những nỗi khổ đó tui đã tích tụ từ nhiều đời trước, rồi ở đầu đời này cho tới thời thanh niên, tui đã project nó ra ngoài 2 lần:
					- Lần đầu là thuở ấu thơ, chứng kiến cảnh "dĩa bay trong nhà", tui đã project ba mẹ mình ra thành người nam và người nữ tổng quát.
					- Lần sau, sau cái dậm chưn năm lớp 9, tui đã project nỗi khổ của mình ra nỗi khổ của mọi người.
				- Và tới 2015, khi bước vào làm hành giả, tui mới quay trở lại thu những "nỗi khổ thế gian" đó về chính mình, nhận thức rõ là "mình đang khổ" cái đã còn người ta có khổ hay không tính sau. Và dạo gần đây thì tui đã đi giáp vòng tròn, quay lại khóc nức nở cho chính mình, như chuyện "thân phận con đĩ nhỏ" tui kể hôm trước đó.
				- Đó kể ra thì chỉ có thể nói những sự kiện bộc lộ ra ngoài vậy thôi, chứ bên trong thì sao nói được?! Làm sao có thể diễn tả được cái sự phi lý đùng đùng rằng "mình với nó rõ ràng tách biệt nhau mà sâu bên trong lại là một" được!? 🤪
				- Hồi "lên núi" 3 tháng dịch Covid-19, tui đã thí nghiệm vụ này rồi: nhắm mắt lại cảm nhận, tui "thấy rõ" mình với nó là một, nhưng mở mắt ra thì mình cũng thấy rõ bằng cặp mắt ngoài này rằng mình tách biệt với nó. Đó là sự mâu thuẫn cơ bản, là Liar Paradox, là cỗ máy xoay tít, là động cơ của cả thế giới này.
				- Đây là cái nhìn bên trong: Cả thế giới bên ngoài chỉ là một quả cầu
					- ![Hand_with_Reflecting_Sphere.jpg](../assets/Will/story/2025-Feb/Hand_with_Reflecting_Sphere.jpg)
				- Đối với cái view bên trong thì cặp mắt ngoài này là đang nhìn vào trong quả cầu đó, cái gọi là "thế giới bên ngoài" chỉ là cái "chậu cá" mà thôi. Những thứ bên ngoài là tách biệt với nhau trong cái chậu cá đó nhưng được kết nối với nhau ở thế giới bên trong này. Sự ngược ngạo trong/ngoài đó giống như phim Matrix vậy.
				- Circle graph
				  collapsed:: true
					- ![Ageev_5X_circle_graph.svg.png](../assets/Will/story/2025-Feb/Ageev_5X_circle_graph.svg.png)
				- Hoặc nói theo dimensionalism thì thế giới bên ngoài là không gian 1D trên cái vòng tròn chu vi của circle graph, bản chất là tách biệt lẫn nhau, còn thế giới bên trong là cả cái đĩa tròn 2D bên trong chứa đựng các kết nối.
				- Thế giới vật lý bên ngoài chỉ có 3 chiều, còn thế giới thông tin bên trong thì có vô số chiều (không giới hạn). Nên "chiều không gian khác" không phải nằm bên ngoài khoảng không vũ trụ, mà nằm trong chính chúng ta, trong mỗi hạt cơ bản.
				- Cái này thì nãy giờ tui nói nhiều rồi hen. Nhưng câu hỏi có lẽ cần đổi lại là "tại sao thấy cái khổ cả thế gian mà không thấy cái sướng cả thế gian?"
				- Thực tình là tui cũng không rõ tại sao, mình chỉ thấy gì (bên trong) thì nói vậy thôi, ko thấy thì chỉ biết là không thấy chứ cũng không biết tại sao. Tui đi qua địa ngục nhiều, từ nhỏ cũng đã muốn "tham quan địa ngục xem sao" chứ chưa bao giờ muốn "tham quan thiên đàng". Thực tế trong tui nó như vậy. Còn nếu cố giải thích thì có thể nói là do nghiệp! 😆
				- Tui cũng đã thử qua các cái sướng của thế gian lẫn những vị ngọt vi tế của thiền định xuất thế gian, nhưng không có cái nào hấp dẫn tui cả, luôn thấy chỉ là mặt đối lập của cái khổ mà thôi. Nghĩa là tui luôn thấy "sướng bao nhiêu, khổ bấy nhiêu" nên không thấy nó có gì hay ho.
				- Chỉ có điều là sau này tui có áp dụng công thức đảo lại, tức "khổ bao nhiêu, sướng bấy nhiêu" cho thế giới bên ngoài để mình bớt bị vướng vào "tha ái", để không bị cuốn vào nỗi khổ của người khác.
				- Nói cách khác thì công thức "sướng = khổ" chỉ là lý thuyết, là ý thức của tui, là cái tui thấy ra, nhưng chưa phải là cái tui đã đạt được trong thực hành. Trên con đừơng thực hành thì tui vẫn thấy khổ nhiều hơn vì nó là động lực thúc đẩy mình giải thoát, là chỗ tui đang đứng, có lẽ vì những đời trước tui đã sướng nhiều rồi.

			- This diagram was drafted at the very early phase of Unithread when i meditated on Wave Equation & Einstein's Special Relativity. The first paper draft was... i'm not sure but must be before 2015.
			- The [action S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics)) in the middle of the bottom was new to me at that time. Its position in the pyramid, has shown me its importance, no less than the [principle of least action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_stationary_action).
			- Later on, after 2015 (while my mother's illness had got worse), i was used to meditate the corresponding of this pyramid with the [5 aggregates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandha)... but always with some mismatch!
				- Only recently did i find a better match between the 5 aggregates with the [effect circle](((67b183f5-dba7-4a11-8a72-3c619e3709ea))) & ((67b183f5-1cca-4473-917e-60c644dd5466)).

				- Note that in those days, i'd not coined the term ((66ab75a1-f4a0-4bab-a002-8e573546623a)) yet, thus “unithread” is used instead.

			- The uniform linear motion of the ((67a98760-71fa-4033-9c42-f3025d632d04)) is just an abstraction at the macro view, just the trailing history of the obop, the extensional product of the interunion between intent circles.
			  collapsed:: true
				- At the micro level, the obop “rolls on” with various interactive forces and curvatures. However the total of these forces is 0, hence no force is visible at the macro level.
				- A uniform obop is just a round circle with intrinsic curvature for **rolling motion**, but all curvatures are canceled out for a uniform linear motion of the center.
				- In brief, it's **rolling uniformly**, not sliding!
				- This intrinsic force has been observed and warned from the very early time of Uniinfo, but later on, when focusing on the interunion operation in Unithread, somehow i dismissed it for the sake of simplicity.
			- The micro-interactions within the obop, carried out by micro-obops, are the ones that mediate changes between levels of abstractions: derivatives in dynamics, layers of sustents in interunion.
			- The simplest micro-obop is the [Ω-thread loop](((67b183f5-f8fe-4b88-99c1-530fec38ae93))), the “bump” of thread like the shape of letter “capital Omega” `Ω`, the [soliton wave-packet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton), the _non-touching_ [Newton's cradle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cradle).

				- The “non-touching Newton's cradle” is not a cradle with hanging strings, but a frictionless straight track of balls placed in separate positions.

			  collapsed:: true
				- Various times previously, i've been deluded that when we “relax” all the curvatures of the world to restore its straightness, everything will be straight, flat, no more force!
				- No! That's plain wrong! As the subject straightens the world of objects, the subject itself will be curved accordingly, as shown in the [unwrapped planes of the polar plane](((67b541c9-3b4e-4429-8c35-9afaf9f434bf))).
				- In ((66b1cfa4-e22c-4424-bf19-a6ce4649da77)), the more curved the intent, the straighter the extent, and their total curvature is 1 (content).
				- The tangent thread is just an extension of the circles rotating. It “feels straight” or actually “curvature-free” just because the curvatures of the intent circles are abstracted.
					- The curvature-free linear space of tangent thread is just to express the conservation of content, while the cancellation of arrows cannot be expressed there due to their directions being abstracted away.
				- In other words, the total curvature is preserved!

			- Constructions like **“call D N”, “name D N”, “consider D N”, “declare D N”** are good for a short “D” but very confusing for a long description “D”, e.g. 
			  > We _call_ a system whose state changes continuously over time even if the system itself is not moving a [**dynamical system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system), in contrast to a dynamic system governed by the laws of dynamics.
			- The name “N” can easily be lost after such a long description “D”.
			- Copilot rephrased it with if/when clause:
			  > We call a system a **dynamical system** _when_ its whose state changes continuously over time even if the system itself is not moving, in contrast to a dynamic system governed by the laws of dynamics.
			- Or better with passive voice:
			  > A system whose state changes continuously over time even if the system itself is not moving is _called_ a **dynamical system**, in contrast to a dynamic system governed by the laws of dynamics.
			- Or simply use a direct description:
			  > A **dynamical system** _is_ a system whose state changes continuously over time even if the system itself is not moving. This is to contrast with a dynamic system governed by the laws of dynamics.
			- Instead, we can use other constructions like **“refer to D as N”, “regard D as N”, “consider D to be N”, “declare D to be N”**, etc.
			- Actually, i've used the old-fashioned **“consider D as N”** throughout my docs.
				- The old fashion: From [The Britannica Dictionary](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/eb/qa/consider-and-consider-as), Merriam-Webster's Concise Dictionary of English Usage states: “[consider] as constructions are perfectly idiomatic but are not as common in recent use as they have been in the past. Nonetheless, they are still in use and are standard.”
				- The matter gets complicated with [more in-depth discussion about “consider as” on BringMeTheNews](https://bringmethenews.com/life/instagrammar-please-please-stop-saying-considered-as):
					- The New York Times' headline “[Headquarters Of The Times Is Considered As Landmark](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/21/nyregion/headquarters-of-the-times-is-considered-as-landmark.html)” should be “Headquarters Of The Times Is Considered A Landmark”, isn't it?! 😁

			- A "circle of dynamic" refers to *a conceptual model that represents a continuous, cyclical process where elements within a system are constantly interacting, changing, and influencing each other*, often signifying a state of ongoing movement and evolution, much like the circular motion of a wheel.
			- Key points about the "circle of dynamic":
				- **Symbolic representation:** The circle itself symbolizes wholeness, completion, and interconnectedness, implying that all parts of the system are interdependent.
				- **Continual change:** Within the circle, elements are not static but are constantly in flux, moving through different stages or phases of a cycle.
				- **Feedback loops:** The dynamic nature often involves feedback loops, where the outcome of one action influences the next, creating a continuous cycle of adaptation and adjustment.
			- Examples of "circle of dynamic" in different contexts:
				- **Business:** A business cycle could be seen as a circle of dynamic, with stages like product development, launch, growth, maturity, and decline, eventually leading back to innovation and new product development.
				- **Personal development:** A personal growth cycle might include setting goals, taking action, reflecting on progress, adjusting strategies, and repeating the process.
				- **Ecology:** The food chain in an ecosystem can be considered a circle of dynamic, with producers creating food for consumers, who then become food for predators, eventually returning nutrients back to the soil.
			- A "circle of dynamics" refers to *a concept in mathematics, particularly within the field of dynamical systems, where the state space is represented as a circle*, meaning the system's behavior is analyzed within the constraints of a circular boundary, often used to model periodic or cyclical phenomena like rotations or oscillations.
			- Key points about circle dynamics:
				- **Simple space:** The circle provides a relatively simple one-dimensional space to study complex dynamics, making it a valuable tool for understanding fundamental concepts in dynamical systems.
				- **Rotation number:** A crucial concept in circle dynamics, the rotation number describes the average "winding" of a point on the circle as it evolves through time under the dynamical system.
				- **Applications:** Circle dynamics finds applications in various fields including physics (e.g., planetary motion), biology (e.g., circadian rhythms), and engineering (e.g., oscillator systems).
			- Example of a circle dynamics system:
				- **Rotating wheel:** Imagine a point on a spinning wheel - its movement can be modeled as a circle dynamics system, where the rotation angle represents the state and the rotation speed determines the dynamics.

Còn "Luang·por Jiew" là tên thân mật, nghĩa là "ba nhỏ đáng kính" (luang = đáng kính, por = ba/cha, jiew = nhỏ bé), nghe rất là thân thương với ai biết tiếng Thái.
						  
						  Mong anh tinh tấn tu tập với thầy Jiew để lấy lại tâm định tĩnh, có định tĩnh rồi thì trí tuệ mình mới mở ra cho mọi suy nghĩ sáng suốt được. Khi có suy nghĩ sáng suốt rồi thì làm gì cũng tốt. Còn bây giờ mình đổ nhiệt huyết vào "giúp thầy MT" mà tâm mình đang rối rắm thì vô hình trung chẳng giúp được mà lại hoá ra hại, hại cả mình lẫn người ta nữa.

				- [9/3/25 21:18]
				  Hôm nay sau 1 giấc ngủ dài, tui đi tâm hành dạng life review. Trong nhiều cảnh chạy qua, hầu hết là cảnh đời thường, thì có 1 cảnh đậm triết lý nên share ông nè:
				- Trong một cảnh kiểu như từ trên nhìn xuống, thấy rất nhiều người, có một tiếng nói vọng ra:
					- 12 ngàn công nhân này cũng không bằng...
					- AVERAGE! -- Đùng 1 cái từ trên trời rơi xuống 1 chữ "average" cảm giác rất nặng, như 1 tảng đá từ trên trời rơi xuống vậy. Average ở đây là kẻ đại diện cho cả 12 ngàn công nhân kia, là ông vua, ông boss thực chất (có ruột, chứ không phải chỉ là 1 hình thức rỗng ruột)
				- Cái cảnh này chỉ diễn ra trong chớp mắt, nhưng diễn tả ra thì nó dài dòng như vậy đó
				- Nó nhắc nhở tui rằng cái tâm vòng tròn đại diện cho cả vòng tròn, rằng kẻ đứng đầu thực thụ, và những cái form kết tinh của content (chưa rỗng ruột) cũng quan trọng và có sức nặng không kém gì số đông contents kia. Đó là vì sâu thẳm trong tui luôn hướng về đại chúng bình dân, luôn coi thường mấy tên boss 😁
				- Ngày xưa tui còn ghét hết thảy bọn vua chúa, chủ tịch, tổng thống, lớp trưởng, lớp phó đồ 😁
				- Nhưng rồi đó cũng chỉ là một cảnh trong rất nhiều cảnh khác, những lần khóc ngất khi nghĩ về dân tộc, nhân loại đồ cũng chỉ là một giấc mơ... trong rất nhiều giấc mơ... Và nhìn về phía trước, thấy chút nữa thôi mình lại phải tiếp tục bước vào một giấc mơ mà mình biết chắc là nó sẽ cuốn mình đi xa... tui cảm thấy hơi ngán... Nhưng rồi nghe tiếng vợ ngáp... À thì bả tỉnh dậy 1 chút rồi, mình cũng tranh thủ đưa bả đi ăn để về bả còn ngủ tiếp, ngủ bù sau trận cày bán hoa lễ 8/3 mà...
				- Thế là mở mắt ra, tui bước vào giấc mơ... và tui đang nhắn cho ông đây cũng trong cái giấc mơ đó. Ha ha, kẻ mở cặp mắt ngoài thì biểu kẻ nhắm mắt là mơ, kẻ mở con mắt trong (thường nhắm mắt ngoài) thì lại thấy kẻ mở mắt thao láo kia là đang mơ 😁
				- [10/3/25 10:07]
				  Hôm qua tui mở mắt ra bước vào giấc mơ (view Maya của người Ấn Độ), còn hôm nay tui chuyển sang view của người Kogi, mở mắt ra bước vào một con zombie, hay nói theo ngôn ngữ hiện đại là bước vào một con robot. 🤖

			- I lay down and breathed... everything just came briefly and went... the pure serenity is nearly there...
			- But when the story of Mr. Hiệp and Mrs. Hằng came, suddenly, my mind get disturbed with chatterings.
			- I felt their uneasy minds and backgrounds a gain.
			- I wanted to “share” this with Mr. Hiệp... But thanks to my renunciation of facebook these days, i got back to myself...

				  :END:
				- At the end of working hours today, it became worse due to the pressure of both personal works and company works.
			- Saturday, 15 March, with meditation, i shifted the sore throat to phlegm.
			- Sunday, the phlegm seemed to be under control. From 18:00, i took 1 tab of 200μg LSD to see what will be seen while i'm sick.
				- There's nothing strange.
				- In stead of deeper meditation into my lung as i expected, the trip let me go around the overview circle where this sickness is just an essential part. So just enjoy it, enjoy the caugh, no need to take it seriously.
				- Next day (Monday), instead of going to hospital, i decided to share this view on liberation and about "the ultimate result is sickness and dead" with leader Quân.
				- I went to bed to relax my back, where i saw that "just shift the (inner deep) focus, the cough will subside."
			- Monday, i went to company to wrap up the "Java heap" task with Mr. Phương, and returned right in that morning because leader Quân was off.
				- There are many ones coughing in the company and many ones off for sickness. So i'm not alone! 😁
				- Afternoon, waking up after some hours sleeping, i reviewed and saw the cause of my severe cough was the “phase locking”:
					- Attachment (chấp) = phase locking/synch just like hiccup
						- The ((667c0031-0a87-44c9-9e98-6d45893b095f)) generated by observing the breath locks the cough in phase.
					- Driving = phase shifting via sampling change & continuation (aliasing)
						- Coarse grained version of resampling is ignoring which is usually done by people.
						- The normal (subjective) way is to shift focus.
						- [Âm dương đan](((67dce5ed-429b-4279-9fb4-7bf78ddd649a)))
				- Then i did research on “phase locking”.

					- Only now, can i get the [circle map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_tongue#Standard_circle_map) 😁
						- [(ir)rational rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_rotation) + coupling (sine) wave = Arnold circle map
							- (ir)rational rotation: for each turn of the intent circle $i → i+1$, it covers the content $x_{i+1} - x_{i} = Ω$, an (ir)rational number relative to the content circle (= 1).
							- coupling wave: $\frac{K}{2π} \sin(2π x_{i})$ is the “breathing” obop
							- Arnold circle map: $θ_{i+1} - θ_{i} = 2πΩ + K \sin(θ_{i})$ where $θ = 2πx$

							  the breathing intent circle transcycles the content circle
								- ![Another_way_to_view_the_circle_map.png](../assets/Will/story/2025-Mar/Another_way_to_view_the_circle_map.png)
						- The general circle map $θ_{i+1} = g(θ_{i}) + Ω$ is just a general quasiperiodic function $g$ between intent circle & content circle.
						- The [rotation number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_number) is the “frequency” of content cycle over intent turns.
						  $ω = \lim_{n \to ∞} x_{n}/n ≈ Ω$
							- It's also the [winding number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winding_number) of the intent thread around the content circle.
							- Phase locking := rotation number is **rational** ⇒ the limiting rotation number $ω_0$ at $K = 0$ is stable/locked no matter how much “breathing” the coupling wave is.

				- Caught up in the “phase locking” research, my cough got severe.
				- That midnight, recalling [the previous time](((67b541d0-8a10-4eae-8370-8ebab4dd7300))), i produced the “âm dương đan” (陰陽丹) qigong exercise to tame my cough.
				  id:: 67dce5ed-429b-4279-9fb4-7bf78ddd649a
			- Tuesday, i practised âm dương đan the whole day and also advertised it to leader Quân.
				- Going to bed, i found the mental switch to turn the [cough reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough_reflex) off: while still facing the cough, zoom out and hold on other stuffs to pull the mind out of the cough.
				- After 4 hours, i woke up and returned to bed with the same technique... and contemplated the [equivalence of 2 aspects of the zero](((67dcec86-db94-47b0-8687-ab2aa95d7c8a))) before falling asleep.
			- Wednesday, i was shown how badly my [theorist karma](((669a58b9-422a-40d9-adcf-b2aade86c170))) affect my helth.
				- This early morning, i saw the equivalence of 2 aspects of the zero: 
				  id:: 67dcec86-db94-47b0-8687-ab2aa95d7c8a
				  Zero = center = balance = cancellation = concentration = abstraction = point (cone) projection
					- obop = ε =[projection]= 1/ω =[cancellation]= ω - ω
					- Wider the world 🌎 ω, there are more opposites to be cancelled, leaving less things to see as ε, nearer to the center, the average.
					- To return to the center, we must zoom out, back up/off, retreat, refrain, to let the opposites within the objects cancel themselves, instead of going forward to control them, and let the form of the objects recede themselves.
				- From afternoon to midnight, i researched various themes in which the most prominent one is [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates) at last.

						- The scaler $z$ is the “**depth**” of the object, which is the **distance** from the object plane to the viewpoint, and is the height of the ((6672513b-c4b0-4c88-8b30-c60a3c6555a7)).
						- An object at $(x,y,z)$ in 3D space is projected onto the “screen” of Euclidean plane as an image at $(x/z:y/z:1)$.
						- The image of P on a z-scaled plane is $P_z = (x_0⋅z : y_0⋅z : z)$
					- Vector $\vec{v} = (dx:dy:0) = \overrightarrow{(dx,dy)}$ [on Euclidean plane $z = 1$] $= D⋅P$ with ((67dd6cb0-7522-427c-b714-5dd53a678b8d)) and any point $P$ on Euclidean plane $z = 1$

							- The absolute plane $z = 0$ corresponds to the **horizon**, or the Cayley absolute, which is the **limit circle**, the null plane, the light cone.
						- Its magnitude (length) is defined at the standard plane $z =1$, and is scaled accordingly in other z-scaled planes, i.e., on plane $z≠0,\; \vec{v}_z = (dx:dy:0)⋅z = \overrightarrow{(dx⋅z,\, dy⋅z)}$.

						- Translation: All points in space are shifted parallelly in direction $\vec{v}$ via vector $\vec{v}⋅t$ along lines parallel to $l$.
						- Limit: When they are shifted to infinity with $t→∞$, they all converge to the point $(dx:dy:0)$. This is how all parallel lines “converge” to the point at infinity.
						- I.e., point at infinity is just the direction vector $\vec{v}$ of the line $l$, as well as all other lines parallel to $l$.
					- DOING The translation by $\vec{v} = (dx:dy:0)$ is actually a **rotation** due to its [*scale invariance*](((67e1004d-1533-483b-ab39-4b91ffbedbdd))) throughout all z-scaled planes: $\vec{v}_z = \overrightarrow{(dx⋅z,\, dy⋅z)}$ [on plane $z≠0$] $= \vec{v} = \overrightarrow{(dx, dy)}$ [on the standard plane $z = 1$].

							- Parabolic rotation = shearing, with **parabolic angle = shear factor** $s = \tan(φ)$
							  $(x, y) → (x, \; y + s⋅x)$
								- φ is the direct (apparent) circular angle between the radial (sheared) line and the horizontal line.

									- While the **shear** is *usually thought as unidirectional*, its **bidirectional** nature, i.e. rotating around the origin, is stressed with the pair of lines (a degenerate parabola) $x^2 = r^2$ instead of single lines $x = r$.
									- Transforming the complex plane, we have similar grids with distortions:
										- [Log-polar grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-polar_coordinates) $\exp(u+iv)$ has circles expanding exponentially against $u$.
										- Square root hyperbolic grid $\sqrt{u+iv}$ has hyperbolas spacing in square roots of $u, v$.

				- Due to being caught up in these researches, i was fallen into severe coughs again.
			- Thursday, a day of meditation.
				- With deep meditation, my cough had nearly gone before i went to bed.
				- Going to bed, i'd experienced the full process of drowning then passed away.
					- In [the previous time](((67b541d0-8a10-4eae-8370-8ebab4dd7300))) as well as the last days, the process was not clear because of the sleepiness at the end.
					- This time, being awake like a god (“thức thần”), i experienced the full range of the cough reflex, the wrestle, and then the liberation through the death.
					- I experimented both mehods of shifting focus: focus on the imaginations, and focus on the death.
			- Today, Friday 21 March, after 4 days off, i went to company in order to attend a meeting, but leader Quân is off again! So i just write these stories down.

				- The cold air in the room made my trachea constricted making the cough reduced, the phlegm dries out... until i had lunch.
				- After lunch, i coughed a lot and saw dried phlegm blobs.
				- There are still many ones coughing in the company.
			- Weekends, i spent time for sleeping and reconnecting with friends.
				- Mr. Hiệp's returned to Vietnam and will stay here for 3 months. So i logged in to fb to exchange phone number to contact via phone.
				- I also gave phone number to Mr. Thanh Long because he asked when i said [good bye on fb](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/14ebMRYAf4/).
				- The cough has improved a lot, but i still get strong coughing reflex every time i get to bed. This a good chance for me to contemplate it and train focusing on death.
				- Last night, before going to bed, i see the nature of **sampling** via ((6672513b-c4b0-4c88-8b30-c60a3c6555a7)) & ((670ce218-a01f-4609-b7f2-beda7cf2ebc3))

			- Today, Monday 24 March, back to the company, i'm completing the theories in the previous days.
				- Before sleep, in the restroom, i recalled the property “everything is a rotation”:
					- Every change is just a transformation preserving content.
					- The unchanged content is the “radius” of the rotation making it turn around.
					- The change of the visible forms (yang) is always balanced by the complementary change of the invisible forms (yin).
					- So, every change is a group action.
				- Going to bed, there was no more cough reflex.... but just nearly 3 hours later, the cough emerged from the sleep.
					- I dealt with it until morning, hence only 3 hours sleep!
			- Tuesday, i'm tired due to the lack of sleep.

				- Before work, i contemplated the 3 types of rotations: circular, parabolic and hyperbolic. I see how the spitting of the null lines (horizons) extends the circular ratation to parabolic rotation, and then squeezes it into hyperbolic rotation: ((67e29bdb-9bce-4cb8-b993-79aa130a1831))
				- Created ((67e299fa-4f76-482a-b586-adacb17dc064))
				- Before sleep, in the restroom, i recalled that the hyperbolic rotation is just a plane projection (conic section) of the parabolic rotation projected onto the light cone which was shown in my very first GeoGebra applet [MixedCoords](https://www.geogebra.org/m/jeexkfrd).
				  collapsed:: true
					- The dual view of parabolic & hyperbolic rotations is also the dual view of projective thread and [function graphing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function) on [orthogonal coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_coordinates).
					- Ironically, i met the dual view of projective thread & function graphing (around 2018) long after the dicovery of the “mixed coordinates” (before 2015) without recognizing they are one. Moreover, the projective nature of conic sections, i.e. [“why slicing the cone”](https://www.geogebra.org/m/nknaryzz), was discovered much later, only when i studied projective geometry (2020).
					- History of graphing of functions, loci of relations (curves), and trajectories of objects
						- The invention of function graphing on orthogonal coordinates is closely tied to the development of **analytic geometry**, which emerged in the 17th century, but it has precursors from medieval maths.
						- Nicole Oresme (1323–1382), a medieval mathematician, made earlier contributions by [visualizing quantities as geometric representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme#Mathematics), which can be seen as precursors to modern graphing.
						- René Descartes (1596–1650) is often credited with formalizing the use of orthogonal coordinates (the [Cartesian plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_plane)) in his work *La Géométrie* (1637), where he introduced the idea of representing algebraic equations as geometric curves.
						- Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665) independently developed similar ideas around the same time. Fermat worked on a treatise titled *Ad locus planos et solidos isagoge*, which outlined concepts of analytic geometry, but he did not publish his work widely.
					- History of vector analysis
						- Newton and Leibniz utilized Cartesian coordinates to develop the calculus of differential and integral, laying groundwork the field of vector analysis, like the [parallelogram law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram_law) in *Principia Mathematica* (1687), and of linear algebra, like the solution of linear systems by Leibniz in 1693.
						- By the end of 18th century and early 19th century, [complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number) was brought to the Cartesian plane, called [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane), by Caspar Wessel (1797), Jean-Robert Argand (1806), and Carl Friedrich Gauss (early 19th century).
							- Ironically, while Descartes gave the name “[imaginary number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number)” to $i$, he didn't put complex numbers onto his own Cartesian plane!
						- Hamilton invented the [quaternion numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) (1843), extending the complex numbers, to handle mechanics in 3D space properly, esp. the 3D rotation and [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
						- In 1844 Hermann Grassmann published his "Theory of Extension" founding the modern [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) with "inner product" for [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) and "outer product" for [exterior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_product). Because his theory predated vector calculus, he use terms like “stretch” to call the modern notion of “vector”.
						- Near the end of the 19th century, Gibbs and Heaviside simplified the 4D quaternions to create the [vector calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus) for 3D space, as shown in the book *Vector Analysis* (1901). This was in parallel with the development of [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) for linear algebra by Peano in 1888 and Salvatore Pincherle in 1897.

						- Traditionally, the relationship between quantities, e.g. (x, y), is usually decribed with function, e.g. $y = f(x)$, or more generally with relation, e.g. $R(x, y) = 0$, both of which can be plotted on the Cartesian plane xOy as a graph (of function) or a curve (of relation). There, each quantity is expressed by an orthogonal axis.
						- However, in ((66ac41f1-de0c-48cb-a9b0-c30b0fe27c5d)), the relation is usually expressed as the relative angles between the threads of these quantities.
							- Relativity:
								- The angles show how much they are apart/different from each other.
								- In reverse, the scalar product of the direction vectors shows the correlation between them.
								- The relativity is shown by the mutual distance, mutual angle, scalar product, mutual stretch in shearing, etc.
							- All these threads are combined into a **compound thread** by synchronizing points, which are called [coincidences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(geometry)), knots, contact points, etc.
							- When the compound thread is projected to different lines and curves (spaces in general), the images are called “**projective threads**” which show the **distributions** of these quantities in different spaces.
						- Around 2018,
						- In October 2019, ((67e38d9c-aec4-460f-acf3-d91a382372be)) was written to illustrate the relativity between quantities.

								- Lâu lâu 2 ông cụ nhà mình mới có dịp gặp nhau, ấy thế mà nói được vài câu là đã mâu thuẫn rồi:
									- Ô.Ngoại: Tôi đi được 3 mét rồi ông mới đi được có 1 mét. Sao ông đi chậm vậy?!
									- Ô.Nội: Mỗi bước tôi đi được 3 tấc còn ông mỗi bước chỉ được có 1 tấc. Sao ông bước ngắn thế?!
									- Ô.Ngoại: Tôi bước ngắn nhưng mà nhanh, ông so từng bước thế sao được?! Trong lúc ông bước được một bước 3 tấc của ông thì tôi đã bước được 9 bước, tức là 9 tấc rồi. Rốt cuộc tôi vẫn hơn! 😃
									- Ô.Nội: Đó chỉ là số đo bên ngoài thôi! Mình phải biết tiết kiệm sức chứ: Này nhé, tôi bước dài và chậm còn ông bước ngắn và nhanh nên một bước của tôi cũng tốn sức bằng với một bước của ông thôi. Nếu như trong một chuyến đi, nếu mình đủ sức cho 1000 bước, thì ông đi được 100 mét đã mệt, còn tôi đi được tới 300 mét mới mệt. 🙂
								- ... Nói qua nói lại, ai cũng có cái hay riêng của người đó, nên rốt cuộc chẳng ai hơn ai. Ấy gọi là "tương đối" vậy. 😉 Như trên sơ đồ bên dưới, thực ra ông Ngoại (Ps) và ông Nội (Pt) đều nằm trên cùng một vòng tròn, chỉ lệch nhau một góc mà thôi. Nhưng nếu đem "ông kia" chiếu lên trục của "ông này" thì bên nào cũng thấy bên kia chỉ bằng có 1/3 của mình mà thôi.
							- Every now and then, the two grandfathers in my family get a chance to meet. But no sooner do they exchange a few words than they find themselves in disagreement:
								- Ma.Granny: I've already walked 3 meters while you've only managed 1 meter. Why are you so slow?!
								- Pa.Granny: Well, with each step, I cover 30 centimeters, while you only manage 10 centimeters per step. Why are your steps so short?!
								- Ma.Granny: My steps are short but fast; you can't compare step by step like that! While you take one of your long 30-centimeter strides, I take 9 short steps, covering a total of 90 centimeters. In the end, I'm still ahead! 😃
								- Pa.Granny: That’s just an external measurement! One must conserve their energy. Look here, I take long and slow strides, while you take short and rapid ones. In terms of effort, one of my steps requires just as much energy as one of yours. So, in a journey where we have the energy for 1000 steps, you'd only manage 100 meters before getting tired, whereas I'd cover 300 meters before tiring out. 🙂
							- ... Back and forth they go, each with their own perspective and merits. In the end, neither is better than the other. It's what we call "relativity." 😉 As shown in the diagram below, in reality, Maternal Grandfather (Ps) and Paternal Grandfather (Pt) both lie on the same circle, only separated by an angle. But if one were to project "the other" onto their axis, each would only see the other as a third of themselves.

				- 3 hours into the sleep, i woke up to cough... no more phlegm, only thick clear mucus. It's so sticky in my throat that i's about the vomit, just like the first days of this illness.
					- The cough reflex kicked in and persisted... I meditated to calm it down.
					- After half an hour dealing with the cough, i lay down to sleep but got sleepy for just an hour and then woke up.
					- From then on, i has been godly awake (thức thần) after my meditation entering the “dead state”!
					- Then i called my wife up to share with her the meditative state. I guided her to review her own state: she discovered that she had been heavy, not as “normal” as she thought. She relaxed, reviewed, and we had sex before i went to work.
