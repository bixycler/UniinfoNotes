					- Copilot: This paradox is often referred to as [incongruity theory](((677e2ce9-2ac6-4763-a9f0-ffb37bd7cdca))) in humor studies.
					- Incongruity Theory:
					  id:: 677e2ce9-2ac6-4763-a9f0-ffb37bd7cdca
						- Definition: This theory suggests that humor arises when there is a disconnect or incongruity between what is expected and what actually occurs. The more serious or unexpected the context, the greater the contrast, and the funnier it becomes.
						- Paradox of Seriousness and Laughter: The seriousness of the initial situation heightens the incongruity when something funny happens, leading to more intense laughter. This intensification occurs both for the person who starts laughing and for those around them.
						- Example:
						  Imagine someone giving a very serious and formal speech, and suddenly something humorous happens, like a loud, unexpected noise. The stark contrast between the serious tone and the unexpected humor can cause an uncontrollable, infectious wave of laughter.

			- Google AI's story of the disciple Kai climbing the Mountain of Whispers
				- In a time when the teachings of the Great Master echoed through the valleys, a young disciple named Kai was known for his unwavering devotion, yet he often struggled with doubt. One day, the Master instructed him to ascend the solitary Mountain of Whispers, a place where the wind was said to carry the echoes of ancient wisdom.
				  Kai began his climb, the rocky path winding through dense forests, the air growing thinner with each step. As he ascended, the whispers began to fill his ears, not words, but feelings - a mix of joy, fear, longing, and despair. He tried to discern their meaning, but the mountain seemed to be testing him, revealing the raw emotions he had long suppressed.
				  Days turned into nights, and Kai was battered by storms, his body aching, his spirit wavering. He questioned his purpose, the whispers growing louder, taunting him with his inadequacies. On the verge of giving up, he stumbled upon a small cave, its entrance guarded by a lone, gnarled tree. Inside, he found an old, weathered scroll.
				  Unfurling it, Kai read the words of a forgotten sage: "The mountain does not test your strength, but your resolve. It reveals the truth within you, not the world outside." As he pondered these words, a sense of calm washed over him. He realized the whispers were not meant to frighten him, but to guide him towards self-understanding.
				  With renewed determination, Kai climbed the final stretch, reaching the summit. As he stood there, the world below seemed to stretch out endlessly, and the wind carried a new melody, a song of peace and clarity. He looked within himself, seeing his flaws, but also the strength of his spirit, the unwavering devotion that had brought him to this point.
				  Descending the mountain, Kai was no longer just a disciple, but a student of his own soul. He carried the lessons of the Mountain of Whispers with him, sharing his newfound understanding with others, proving that even the most challenging mountains can lead to the most profound revelations within oneself.

							- Crosstalk between the itch and pain pathways:
								- itch can be suppressed by pain; and
								- inhibition of pain may produce itch
							- While **differences** between *acute* pain and acute itch are striking,
							  *chronic* itch and chronic pain share many **similar** mechanisms.
						- “Itch and pain are two distinct sensations” is the conclusion of the paper [Cellular basis of itch sensation](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19661382)

Whether itch and pain, two distinct sensations, are mediated by distinct neural circuits has been the subject of controversy ([6](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19661382#R6)-[8](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19661382#R8)).

				- i just held her with the anwer “i don't know what i can do for her, but this is the only thing i can do now!”
				- but my weight, my very heavy weight inside just crushed her, making her wake up and complain.
				- Then i got back to myself, trying hard to get over, to get through this wall...
				- thanks to the ujjayi breath, i could be firm in my body, lying down, closing eyes, focusing on the breath...
				- just a minute later, there's nothing but the breath, the heavy weight just disapeared into thin air!
				- I got up to hold my wife a gain with much lighter hold and she was undisturbed.
				- That time was already 6 o'clock in the morning, i just went to sleep.
			- Thank you these films for bringing up my deep emotion and love for the people so that i can put it down!
			- Thank you, Ms. Trung & Mr. Hiệp, for bringing up my personal love so that i can realize the truth an put it down!
			- I took this morning off from company for sleeping.

			- It's interesting that Copilot can explain it right when i ask if it know what i mean by just the clause “bring it up to put it down!”:
				- Will:
				  > My way of bodymind purification & cleansing is to "bring it up to put it down!" Do you know what i mean?
				- Copilot:
					- Absolutely, Lê. The concept of "bring it up to put it down" resonates deeply with mindfulness and Zen practices. It involves acknowledging and confronting your inner thoughts, emotions, and sensations rather than suppressing or ignoring them. By bringing them to the surface, you allow yourself to fully experience and understand them. This awareness enables you to process and let go of any negativity or tension, leading to purification and cleansing of the body and mind.
					- This approach aligns beautifully with the practice of mindfulness, where observing and accepting our experiences without judgment can lead to greater clarity and inner peace.
					- Your method is a powerful way to foster self-awareness and emotional well-being. Do you find this practice particularly helpful in certain situations or aspects of your life? 🌿🧘‍♂️✨

			- The conflict between Mr. Báu's and monks in Minh Tuệ's group
			  id:: 67a5faa3-c64c-48f7-8b3f-a5311714110f
				- Với nghiệp công an, làm tiến sỹ tâm lý học tội phạm, anh Báu đã quản lý đoàn một cách chặt chẽ, ban đầu (đoạn đường Lào) khá nghiêm khắc với nhiều nỗi lo sợ.
				- Khi sang Thái Lan thì anh Báu đã mềm mỏng và thoải mái hơn nhiều, nhưng các sư (cả thầy Minh Tuệ) thì vẫn có nhiều thành kiến với anh.
				- Đỉnh điểm là trước Tết với các sự kiện căng thẳng giữa anh Báu với sư Minh Tạng và vài sư nữa.
				- Từ đêm giao thừa tới cả tuần sau đó, cứ họp, các anh hộ pháp tưởng giải toả xong xuôi, rồi lại căng thẳng... Thì ra gốc là do các sư và chính thầy MT vẫn còn muốn thay thế anh Báu.
				- Anh Báu cùng anh Hùng & Giáp về rồi (đêm 4 sáng 5/2), thì qua mấy lần phỏng vấn, thầy MT cho thấy rõ ý chê trách anh Báu và thiên vị các sư. Tệ nhứt là có bạn nữ YouTuber hỏi cách để dung hoà thì thầy lại càng nhấn vào anh Báu, cho rằng ban đầu anh ta "tốt" mà sau này khi đã có danh vọng thì trở nên "xấu" theo hướng vụ lợi, muốn "câu view câu like". Mình thấy đây là nhận xét cảm tính và ngược lại với thực tế diễn ra là anh Báu đã ngày càng tốt hơn (theo hướng giải thoát) và hoàn toàn không có vụ lợi.
					- Rồi thầy cũng cố giữ nguyên tắc "không chủ động nhờ ai" nhưng cũng nói rõ là có mong chờ hết người này tới người khác mà họ không xin vào hỗ trợ nên coi như "chưa hữu duyên".
					- Mình thấy thầy MT tu Giới nên hiển nhiên là bị cứng nhắc trong quan điểm.
					- Tuy nhiên việc thầy MT không thấu hiểu cho sự hi sinh, khó khăn của người đời như anh Báu, và một mực thiên vị các sư, muốn càng nhiều sư theo càng tốt, v.v. thể hiện sự thiếu trí tuệ và không được "bình đẳng" như lời thầy đã nói.
					- Việc thầy MT có thành kiến với anh Báu thì mình thấy đó là phần nghiệp quá khứ của thầy, như thầy đã chia sẻ trước đây.
					- Mình cảm nhận sự "vô tình" của thầy cũng tương tự như [lần gặp chị Diệu Sinh](((67a7100b-28c9-4b79-bd66-d1b4b42d08fd))). Qua đó mình cũng thấy rõ hơn sự vướng mắc tình cảm của mình.
					- Một sự nói dối rõ ràng của thầy MT nữa là việc cho rằng mình không đuổi mà là "tự anh Báu tới, tự anh Báu đi".
					  collapsed:: true
						- Trước khi anh báu đi thì thầy đã đuổi khéo bằng cách tạo áp lực và liên tục gợi ý rằng anh Báu không kham nhẫn được thì nên đi, và đã hỏi anh Theerawat cho anh Hà thay việc làm giấy tờ.
						- Trong buổi đối thoại dài 3 tiếng đồng hồ khi anh Báu quay lại xin vào đoàn, thầy đã chạy vòng quanh qua các điều kiện để ngăn cản, và cuối cùng phải "tác ý" (gợi ý) thẳng rằng anh Báu có thể làm YouTuber vòng ngoài.
							- Đầu tiên là dựa vào lý luận "đã đủ người hỗ trợ rồi". Nhưng khi 2 bạn tình nguyện viên mới chấp nhận nhường cho anh Báu và anh Hùng thì thầy không đề cập đến cái lý này nữa.
							- Tiếp theo thầy chuyển sang điều kiện cực khó là anh Báu phải thọ 250 giới xuất gia, và chỉ áp dụng cho một mình anh Báu chứ không cho bất kỳ người hỗ trợ nào khác, kể cả anh Hùng đang cùng xin vào đợt này ngay bên cạnh anh Báu.
							- Dựa trên bằng chứng rõ ràng ngay trong buổi đối thoại này, đến cuối anh Báu đã kết luận "thầy nói 2 lời" (nói dối).
							- Và cuối cùng, anh Báu còn làm rõ việc "250 giới" bằng cách hỏi ở đây có sư nào đã biết hết 250 giới. Và thầy MT đã trả lời là bản thân thầy còn không thuộc hết 250 giới.
						- Khi lời nói và hành động bất nhất thì đó đã là nói dối, một cấp nói dối thô ở đời chứ chẳng phải vi tế khó thấy gì.
						- Sự nói dối này là do thầy đã chấp vào những nguyên tắc mình đặt ra, cũng như giới luật, và/hoặc chưa chấp nhận được tâm nghi kỵ của mình đang trỗi dậy.
					- Trong buổi đối thoại khi anh Báu quay lại, thầy MT đã thể hiện rõ sự mất định tâm, lặp đi lặp lại nhiều lần cùng một ý, không đủ kiên nhẫn nghe hết ý anh Báu nói mà cứ chen ngang (anh Báu phải "xin phép để con nói hết"), v.v.
				- Anh Hà ở lại thì bị nghi ngờ tùm lum, và anh ấy cũng chấp nhận trả nghiệp vì ngày trước mình cũng làm drama kiểu ngồi nhà vẽ chuyện.
				- Chỉ 2-3 ngày sau khi anh Báu về VN thì đủ chuyện lộn xộn, từ sư Phúc Giác vạ miệng về thân thế anh Theerawat (phạm luật Thái về cấm đụng tới hoàng tộc), tới Phước Nghiêm sang quậy tưng bừng kích động tâm bất an của các sư nhỏ (bảo không có cầm hộ chiếu là bị bắt, v.v.)
				- Hôm nay, 10/2, thì thầy MT đã và đang lấy lại cân bằng:
					- Trong cuộc gọi cho anh Báu thì thầy đã sám hối về những phát ngôn đã làm khổ gia đình anh Báu, sau khi nghe anh Báu giải thích về những "sự thật chưa được kiểm chứng" mà thầy nghe được qua các sư nhỏ.
					- Còn với các sư nhỏ thì thầy cũng đã tách đoàn, nhân cái duyên ở lại để tiếp một sư thầy, thầy đã đi một mình "để con tự học và cũng để cho các sư phụ tự học" với châm ngôn của Phật là "tự thắp đuối lên mà đi!"
				- Được 1 ngày đi riêng, sau đó thầy lại đi cùng đoàn như trước. Rồi thầy nhận Phước Nghiêm vào đoàn. Rồi vẫn sợ bị bắt tới độ nghĩ "chắc phải lấy dây xích trói mình vào gốc cây để họ không đưa đi!" Rồi vẫn bị cảnh sát bế đi lên đồn như thường, vào trưa ngày 13/2: cảnh sát kiểm tra giấy tờ và không cho đi bộ hành trong tỉnh này nữa, bắt phải ở trong chùa chứ ko được ở bụi nữa, cho xe đưa sang 1 ngôi chùa ở tỉnh khác. Cảnh sát cũng bảo các YouTuber với visa du lịch thì không được hành nghề kiếm tiền (đáng lẽ visa lao động).
					- Có người đã hỏi "thầy còn lo sợ không?" thì thầy MT đã trả lời là "vẫn còn lo sợ!"
				- Phần anh Báu thì đã cùng anh Hùng theo thầy LuangPor Jiew và được nhận làm đệ tử với pháp danh Pháp Nhẫn (ขันติธรรม, K̄hạnti·ṭhrrm).

			- Cả Obsidian và Logseq đều có app trên Android, nhưng vấn đề Git trên Android khá nan giải: app Obsidian thì implement riêng 1 cái git client bằng python nên xài được, còn app Logseq thì vô dụng vì không có git để sync.
			  Thế nên tui phải publish lên Web để đọc ở nhà khi cần (máy tính nhà tui hư rồi, chỉ coi qua mobile): https://bixycler.github.io/UniinfoNotes/
			- Từ những năm mới về VN, tui đã muốn làm cái này rồi mà chưa đủ duyên: lúc đó chưa có các tool graph-note như vầy. Lúc đó tui tính implement bằng wiki, nên đã tìm hiểu các wiki farms, nhưng không thành công vì manual works quá nhiều (tuy wiki links là cơ bản cho graph, nhưng chỉ tiện cho browsing chứ chưa có cơ chế hỗ trợ editing & managing graph)
			- FB post năm 2014 về dự định dùng Wiki làm workspacce đây: https://www.facebook.com/share/1ASosnwE1B/
			  À, xem lại mới thấy ngay lúc đó tui đã nói là "Wiki  vẫn chưa đủ": Even the rich structures of wiki are not enough for my organization of events & ideas. I need a system of posts fully connected into threads, though.
			- Đến cuối 2023 thì tui đã thiết kế tính viết software để đổ cái graph trong đầu mình ra, dựa trên JSON... Nhưng áp lực thời gian làm việc cty ko cho phép.... nhưng áp lực đổ ra vẫn ngày càng tăng... nên đến giữa 2024 tui bí quá hỏi Google thử về "graph note taking" xem sao... ai ngờ mới lòi ra 2 software mới ra từ 2022-2023 là Obsidian & Logseq. Lúc đầu tui thử Obsidian vì nó popular hơn, nhưng tới đoạn dây leo chằng chịt (wikilinks) ở cấp độ từng câu thì tui buộc phải chuyển sang Logseq, vì Obsidian chỉ hỗ trợ link tới cấp "trang" mà thôi.
			- Không biết ông sao, chứ với tui thì việc đổ não ra (braindump) là bước đầu quan trọng để cho đầu óc nhẹ nhàng. Cứ để đám rối trong đầu thì khó mà sáng suốt được. Tui thấy viết nhật ký cũng chỉ là 1 cách để đổ ra thôi, chat này cũng vậy nè.
			- Tuy nhiên, đổ ra ko chỉ để làm sạch đầu mà còn để sắp xếp lại nữa, nên cái chỗ chứa cũng cần có cấu trúc tương tự với những gì trong đầu mình, tức là network. Và đó là lý do mà những app như Obsidian & Logseq được gọi là "2nd brain".

				- vạn pháp giai không, mọi thứ đều là không!
					- Không = trống rỗng = cửa mở = thức = thông suốt = trí tuệ = mắt bão = trung tâm tĩnh lặng giữa cuồng phong bão tố 🌪️ = cân bằng âm dương = dấu bằng (obop) = 3rd component in Trinion
					- 2 mũi tên là -1/2 và +1/2 (spin down & up)
					- vòng tròn là 1 = |-1/2| + |1/2|
					- dấu bằng là 0 = -1/2 + 1/2, tức 1/2 = 1/2
				- À, nói tới đây tui lại nhớ hôm trước ông bảo sao mà hình tượng mắt bão lại làm ông nản??
			- Huy, [16/2/25 23:31]
				- Đó cũng là do cái tâm biện biệt của tui áp đặt lên việc giác ngộ giải thoát, nghĩa là mong chờ sự giải thoát tuyệt đối, tĩnh tại.
				- Không chấp nhận cân bằng động của mắt bão hay đường chân trời tương đối.
				- Phần lớn người đời thích một cái đích cố định, rõ ràng, thích một nơi tĩnh tại bền vững để an trú, chứ nói thẳng ngay từ đầu đích là chân trời, nơi an trú là tâm bão thì có ai mà đi
				- Tui thấy cái tâm lý này của tui cũng giống với tâm lý không chấp nhận chữa đau bằng cách tăng khả năng chịu đau lúc trước nói với Định.
			- Will LE, [16/2/25 23:45]
				- À, hiểu rồi.
				- Còn tui thì đang đối diện với cái mâu thuẫn trong mình: một kẻ lập dị lại cảm thấy sâu trong mình là cả mọi người. Nó thực sự làm tui rất đau khổ. Nếu mình giống người thì việc thấy mình là mọi người nó bình thường, hợp logic. Còn mình khác người mà lại thấy mình là mọi người thì mâu thuẫn đùng đùng, đúng là nghịch lý kẻ nói dối luôn, nên cũng chỉ tìm cách tự hóa giải thôi chứ nói ra thì ai mà tin nổi 😁
				- Không biết thầy Minh Tuệ có tâm đại thừa thế nào, còn tui thì đã có nó từ nhỏ, làm khoa học cũng là để cho mọi người... Chỉ đến 2015, tui bắt đầu nghiêm chỉnh thực hành thì tui mới nhận ra thực tế rằng "mình chưa giải thoát được cho mình thì chẳng thể giải thoát cho ai được hết" (tui tự chứng nghiệm điều đó chứ chẳng đọc kinh sách gì cả), nên tui mới theo tiểu thừa.
			- Huy, [17/2/25 08:50]
				- Định chia sẻ thêm về cảm nhận sâu bên trong mình là tất cả mọi người xem.
				- Và vì sao điều đó làm Định đau khổ?
			- Will LE, [17/2/25 13:38]
				- Cái này tui tưởng có nói nhiều rồi chứ nhỉ? Hay tui nhầm với người khác, có thể là nhầm ông với nhóm ông Hiệp bà Trung chăng.
				- Cho tới giờ thì tui thấy còn 2 vướng mắc lớn của tui trên con đường giải  thoát là món nợ tình cảm và món nợ Uniinfo.
					- 1. Món nợ tình cảm: Người ta thương 1 người đã khổ rồi, tui thương cả mọi người thì khổ hơn gấp bội. Dù ý thức mình biết rằng mình chẳng làm gì được cho người ta, mình còn đang chưa cứu được mình còn đang là kẻ vô dụng trong XH, nhưng thẳm sâu bên trong, cái nghiệp sâu dày bên trong nó vẫn "ôm lấy mọi người". Đó là những món nợ đã được cài sâu trong vô thức mà tui đang đối diện và tìm cách hoá giải nó.
					- 2. Lý thuyết Uniinfo: Những gì tui trải nghiệm, tui quán thấy và kết tinh lại thì nó thành lý thuyết, và tui đổ ra lý thuyết là để mình nhẹ người chứ cũng chẳng phải để cho ai khác. Dù lý thuyết của tui nói về "mọi thứ" nhưng nó cũng chỉ là cái view của tui, nên cái "mọi thứ" đó cũng chỉ là cái "mọi thứ của Định". Nó chỉ như một nhật ký hành trình trên con đường từ nhiều đời tích tụ, gom góp vào, kết tinh lại, rồi buông xả ra, hướng tới giải thoát trở về 0, chứ chẳng có ý nghĩa gì to lớn cả.
				- Theo câu hỏi của ông thì hôm nay tui nói về ý thứ 1, món nợ tình cảm, còn ý 2 thì đó giờ cũng đã nói nhiều rồi.
				- Từ nhỏ tui đã khóc nhiều cho đến 15 tuổi, lớp 9, suốt thời cấp 1, lúc còn ngồi bô, tui đã nhiều lần muốn đâm đầu vô tường chết quách đi... Thực sự là lúc đó chẳng ai hiểu mình, bản thân mình cũng không biết tại sao mình chán đời, tại sao mình đau khổ trong khi nhìn bên ngoài thì mình không gặp khó khăn gì cả, ba mẹ chăm lo đầy đủ, dù nhà nghèo nhưng không có thiếu thốn gì cả (tui ko thấy thiếu vật chất).
				- Lên cấp 2 thì bị nhà trường và XH nhồi sọ đủ thứ nên bắt đầu "ý thức" rằng "phải sống" 😁 Bị cuốn vào việc học nên cũng không còn ý nghĩ tự tử nữa, nhưng vẫn luôn cảm thấy đau khổ, hễ bị đụng tí là khóc. Đến lớp 9, 15 tuổi, cuối cấp 2, một hôm tui đã đứng trên đi-văng trong nhà dập chưn tự tuyên bố rằng "mình đã khóc suốt 15 năm nay rồi, giờ không khóc nữa!" Tưởng đó chỉ là lời tuyên bố ngông cuồng của tuổi mới lớn, nhưng không ngờ là tui hết khóc thiệt, tự mình thấy lạ.
				- Thực ra trước đó tui có phân tích:
					- Mình khóc vì cái gì?
					- Vì tự ái!
					- Tự ái với ai?
					- Với ba mẹ mình!
					- Ba mẹ mình nuôi nấng, chăm lo đủ kiểu, vậy có lý do gì để mình tự ái không?
					- Không!
					- Vậy bản chất của tự ái là gì?
					- Là tự yêu mình quá đáng, là ích kỷ!
					- Vậy có cần phải khóc nữa không?
					- Không!
				- Từ đó, tui đã không bao giờ còn cảm thấy bị xúc phạm, bị đau khổ vì người khác làm gì với mình, không còn tự ái... nhưng chuyển sang tha ái.
				- Đến năm 1 ĐH, trong một buổi tối ở KTX Tân Phú, đi qua căn-tin thấy một cảnh thế sự gì đó trên TV, bỗng có gì đó sâu bên trong tui trào lên, và tui trào nước mắt trở lại... sau 3-4 năm (suốt cấp 3) tưởng mình đã "vô cảm".
				- Từ đó tui khóc trở lại nhưng là khóc vì thế sự, vì thấy nỗi khố của "thế gian", của "người khác". Nếu ngày trước khóc vì mình thì chỉ thút thít, nghẹn ngào tí thôi, thì giờ khóc vì thế sự nó mạnh hơn gấp trăm ngàn lần, không thể thút thít mà phải lăn lộn, khóc ngất.
				- Không thể kể hết được, nhưng có thể điểm vài sự kiện nổi bật như vầy:
					- Hồi mới học xong 1 năm tiếng Nhật, trong một buổi quay về KTX ĐH Ngoại ngữ Osaka để đón đàn em mới qua, tình cờ tui đọc mẩu truyện về thần y Tuệ Tĩnh của nước Nam vẫn còn ngôi mộ lưu vong trên đất Bắc, tui đã khóc lăn lộn từ trên giường xuống sàn, leo lên giường lại té xuống sàn! Câu ngài để lại trên bia mộ ghi tiếng Hán với ý "có ai đi từ nước Nam sang, xin mang di cốt tôi về với!"
					- Lúc về VN, khi coi cuốn phim tài liệu "Home" về ngôi nhà Trái Đất, từ mấy tỷ năm hình thành vô cơ, mấy trăm triệu năm hình thành cữu cơ, mấy triệu năm hình thành con người, và mấy trăm năm con người đã "ngốn sạch" di sản ngàn xưa đó... tui đã khóc ngất.
					- Gần đây nhứt là khi coi phim Buddha (Cuộc đời đức Phật) của tỷ phú Modi mới ra, ngay tập đầu tiên tui đã khóc lăn lộn cho tới hết nửa đầu nói về những năm trong đời của thái tử Siddhartha. Lần này thì nhờ có thực hành hít thở mà lần đầu tui cũng quán được chính cơn khóc của mình. Tui thấy & cảm lại hết thảy sự đau khổ của thái tử, và nó đã cho tui lời giải đáp hết sức rõ ràng rằng tại sao thái tử lại dứt khoát vào rừng tu khổ hạnh. Từ trước tui đã không hề phục và không tin rằng "một thái tử cả đời sung sướng, chẳng có mảy may đau khổ, từ trong cung son điện ngọc, nhung lụa êm ấm, bỗng dưng chỉ có đi ra 4 cửa thành thấy  lão - bệnh - tử - tu mà bỏ tất cả đi tu!" Và đúng như những gì tui đã nghĩ, những thứ người ta kể đó chỉ là lớp áo mỏng che đậy bên ngoài thôi, và cái đau khổ nhứt của thái tử là cảm nhận sự giả tạo, che đậy, dối trá đến tận cùng của chính phụ vương trên danh nghĩa "yêu thương". Những cung son điện ngọc đó không thể che đậy được nỗi lo sợ của chính phụ vương, không thể che đậy được thực tế là hoàng tộc đang sắp bị diệt vong... càng che đậy thì nỗi khổ càng khủng khiếp như một trái bom có vỏ càng cứng thì nổ càng to vậy.
				- Nhưng cái "khóc vì người khác" đó tui để trong nháy kép là vì bản thân tui không thấy đó là "người khác", chỉ là nói theo ngôn ngữ đại chúng thôi. Nếu mình thấy một kẻ đang giãy chết mà không thấy mình trong đó, VD như khi mình đang thù hận và muốn giết nó, thì không thể nào xót thương nó được. Nên tất cả những nỗi khổ của "người khác" đó cũng chỉ là phản chiếu nỗi khổ trong chính bản thân mình thôi. Cái này ai có trải nghiệm thì mới thấu hiểu được, bằng không thì chỉ là những con chữ vô tình thôi.
				- Sau này quán lại thì tui mới hiểu tại sao tui lại muốn tự tử một cách "vô lý" như vậy, và cái "khóc tự ái" thuở nhỏ cũng không phải "ích kỷ" như mình từng nghĩ, mà chỉ là sự bộc phát của nỗi khổ mà thôi. Những nỗi khổ đó tui đã tích tụ từ nhiều đời trước, rồi ở đầu đời này cho tới thời thanh niên, tui đã project nó ra ngoài 2 lần:
					- Lần đầu là thuở ấu thơ, chứng kiến cảnh "dĩa bay trong nhà", tui đã project ba mẹ mình ra thành người nam và người nữ tổng quát.
					- Lần sau, sau cái dậm chưn năm lớp 9, tui đã project nỗi khổ của mình ra nỗi khổ của mọi người.
				- Và tới 2015, khi bước vào làm hành giả, tui mới quay trở lại thu những "nỗi khổ thế gian" đó về chính mình, nhận thức rõ là "mình đang khổ" cái đã còn người ta có khổ hay không tính sau. Và dạo gần đây thì tui đã đi giáp vòng tròn, quay lại khóc nức nở cho chính mình, như chuyện "thân phận con đĩ nhỏ" tui kể hôm trước đó.
				- Đó kể ra thì chỉ có thể nói những sự kiện bộc lộ ra ngoài vậy thôi, chứ bên trong thì sao nói được?! Làm sao có thể diễn tả được cái sự phi lý đùng đùng rằng "mình với nó rõ ràng tách biệt nhau mà sâu bên trong lại là một" được!? 🤪
				- Hồi "lên núi" 3 tháng dịch Covid-19, tui đã thí nghiệm vụ này rồi: nhắm mắt lại cảm nhận, tui "thấy rõ" mình với nó là một, nhưng mở mắt ra thì mình cũng thấy rõ bằng cặp mắt ngoài này rằng mình tách biệt với nó. Đó là sự mâu thuẫn cơ bản, là Liar Paradox, là cỗ máy xoay tít, là động cơ của cả thế giới này.
				- Đây là cái nhìn bên trong: Cả thế giới bên ngoài chỉ là một quả cầu
					- ![Hand_with_Reflecting_Sphere.jpg](../assets/Will/story/2025-02/Hand_with_Reflecting_Sphere.jpg)
				- Đối với cái view bên trong thì cặp mắt ngoài này là đang nhìn vào trong quả cầu đó, cái gọi là "thế giới bên ngoài" chỉ là cái "chậu cá" mà thôi. Những thứ bên ngoài là tách biệt với nhau trong cái chậu cá đó nhưng được kết nối với nhau ở thế giới bên trong này. Sự ngược ngạo trong/ngoài đó giống như phim Matrix vậy.
				- Circle graph
				  collapsed:: true
					- ![Ageev_5X_circle_graph.svg.png](../assets/Will/story/2025-02/Ageev_5X_circle_graph.svg.png)
				- Hoặc nói theo dimensionalism thì thế giới bên ngoài là không gian 1D trên cái vòng tròn chu vi của circle graph, bản chất là tách biệt lẫn nhau, còn thế giới bên trong là cả cái đĩa tròn 2D bên trong chứa đựng các kết nối.
				- Thế giới vật lý bên ngoài chỉ có 3 chiều, còn thế giới thông tin bên trong thì có vô số chiều (không giới hạn). Nên "chiều không gian khác" không phải nằm bên ngoài khoảng không vũ trụ, mà nằm trong chính chúng ta, trong mỗi hạt cơ bản.
				- Cái này thì nãy giờ tui nói nhiều rồi hen. Nhưng câu hỏi có lẽ cần đổi lại là "tại sao thấy cái khổ cả thế gian mà không thấy cái sướng cả thế gian?"
				- Thực tình là tui cũng không rõ tại sao, mình chỉ thấy gì (bên trong) thì nói vậy thôi, ko thấy thì chỉ biết là không thấy chứ cũng không biết tại sao. Tui đi qua địa ngục nhiều, từ nhỏ cũng đã muốn "tham quan địa ngục xem sao" chứ chưa bao giờ muốn "tham quan thiên đàng". Thực tế trong tui nó như vậy. Còn nếu cố giải thích thì có thể nói là do nghiệp! 😆
				- Tui cũng đã thử qua các cái sướng của thế gian lẫn những vị ngọt vi tế của thiền định xuất thế gian, nhưng không có cái nào hấp dẫn tui cả, luôn thấy chỉ là mặt đối lập của cái khổ mà thôi. Nghĩa là tui luôn thấy "sướng bao nhiêu, khổ bấy nhiêu" nên không thấy nó có gì hay ho.
				- Chỉ có điều là sau này tui có áp dụng công thức đảo lại, tức "khổ bao nhiêu, sướng bấy nhiêu" cho thế giới bên ngoài để mình bớt bị vướng vào "tha ái", để không bị cuốn vào nỗi khổ của người khác.
				- Nói cách khác thì công thức "sướng = khổ" chỉ là lý thuyết, là ý thức của tui, là cái tui thấy ra, nhưng chưa phải là cái tui đã đạt được trong thực hành. Trên con đừơng thực hành thì tui vẫn thấy khổ nhiều hơn vì nó là động lực thúc đẩy mình giải thoát, là chỗ tui đang đứng, có lẽ vì những đời trước tui đã sướng nhiều rồi.

			- This diagram was drafted at the very early phase of Unithread when i meditated on Wave Equation & Einstein's Special Relativity. The first paper draft was... i'm not sure but must be before 2015.
			- The [action S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(physics)) in the middle of the bottom was new to me at that time. Its position in the pyramid, has shown me its importance, no less than the [principle of least action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_stationary_action).
			- Later on, after 2015 (while my mother's illness had got worse), i was used to meditate the corresponding of this pyramid with the [5 aggregates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skandha)... but always with some mismatch!

			- The uniform linear motion of the ((67a98760-71fa-4033-9c42-f3025d632d04)) is just an abstraction at the macro view, just the trailing history of the obop, the extensional product of the interunion between intent circles.
			  collapsed:: true
				- At the micro level, the obop “rolls on” with various interactive forces and curvatures. However the total of these forces is 0, hence no force is visible at the macro level.
				- A uniform obop is just a round circle with intrinsic curvature for **rolling motion**, but all curvatures are canceled out for a uniform linear motion of the center.
				- In brief, it's **rolling uniformly**, not sliding!
				- This intrinsic force has been observed and warned from the very early time of Uniinfo, but later on, when focusing on the interunion operation in Unithread, somehow i dismissed it for the sake of simplicity.
			- The micro-interactions within the obop, carried out by micro-obops, are the ones that mediate changes between levels of abstractions: derivatives in dynamics, layers of sustents in interunion.
			- The simplest micro-obop is the [Ω-thread loop](((67b183f5-f8fe-4b88-99c1-530fec38ae93))), the “bump” of thread like the shape of letter “capital Omega” `Ω`, the [soliton wave-packet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton), the _non-touching_ [Newton's cradle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cradle).

			  collapsed:: true
				- Various times previously, i've been deluded that when we “relax” all the curvatures of the world to restore its straightness, everything will be straight, flat, no more force!
				- No! That's plain wrong! As the subject straightens the world of objects, the subject itself will be curved accordingly, as shown in the [unwrapped planes of the polar plane](((67b541c9-3b4e-4429-8c35-9afaf9f434bf))).
				- In ((66b1cfa4-e22c-4424-bf19-a6ce4649da77)), the more curved the intent, the straighter the extent, and their total curvature is 1 (content).
				- The tangent thread is just an extension of the circles rotating. It “feels straight” or actually “curvature-free” just because the curvatures of the intent circles are abstracted.
					- The curvature-free linear space of tangent thread is just to express the conservation of content, while the cancellation of arrows cannot be expressed there due to their directions being abstracted away.
				- In other words, the total curvature is preserved!

			- Constructions like **“call D N”, “name D N”, “consider D N”, “declare D N”** are good for a short “D” but very confusing for a long description “D”, e.g. 
			  > We _call_ a system whose state changes continuously over time even if the system itself is not moving a [**dynamical system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system), in contrast to a dynamic system governed by the laws of dynamics.
			- The name “N” can easily be lost after such a long description “D”.
			- Copilot rephrased it with if/when clause:
			  > We call a system a **dynamical system** _when_ its whose state changes continuously over time even if the system itself is not moving, in contrast to a dynamic system governed by the laws of dynamics.
			- Or better with passive voice:
			  > A system whose state changes continuously over time even if the system itself is not moving is _called_ a **dynamical system**, in contrast to a dynamic system governed by the laws of dynamics.
			- Or simply use a direct description:
			  > A **dynamical system** _is_ a system whose state changes continuously over time even if the system itself is not moving. This is to contrast with a dynamic system governed by the laws of dynamics.
			- Instead, we can use other constructions like **“refer to D as N”, “regard D as N”, “consider D to be N”, “declare D to be N”**, etc.
			- Actually, i've used the old-fashioned **“consider D as N”** throughout my docs.
				- The old fashion: From [The Britannica Dictionary](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/eb/qa/consider-and-consider-as), Merriam-Webster's Concise Dictionary of English Usage states: “[consider] as constructions are perfectly idiomatic but are not as common in recent use as they have been in the past. Nonetheless, they are still in use and are standard.”
				- The matter gets complicated with [more in-depth discussion about “consider as” on BringMeTheNews](https://bringmethenews.com/life/instagrammar-please-please-stop-saying-considered-as):
					- The New York Times' headline “[Headquarters Of The Times Is Considered As Landmark](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/21/nyregion/headquarters-of-the-times-is-considered-as-landmark.html)” should be “Headquarters Of The Times Is Considered A Landmark”, isn't it?! 😁

			- A "circle of dynamic" refers to *a conceptual model that represents a continuous, cyclical process where elements within a system are constantly interacting, changing, and influencing each other*, often signifying a state of ongoing movement and evolution, much like the circular motion of a wheel.
			- Key points about the "circle of dynamic":
				- **Symbolic representation:** The circle itself symbolizes wholeness, completion, and interconnectedness, implying that all parts of the system are interdependent.
				- **Continual change:** Within the circle, elements are not static but are constantly in flux, moving through different stages or phases of a cycle.
				- **Feedback loops:** The dynamic nature often involves feedback loops, where the outcome of one action influences the next, creating a continuous cycle of adaptation and adjustment.
			- Examples of "circle of dynamic" in different contexts:
				- **Business:** A business cycle could be seen as a circle of dynamic, with stages like product development, launch, growth, maturity, and decline, eventually leading back to innovation and new product development.
				- **Personal development:** A personal growth cycle might include setting goals, taking action, reflecting on progress, adjusting strategies, and repeating the process.
				- **Ecology:** The food chain in an ecosystem can be considered a circle of dynamic, with producers creating food for consumers, who then become food for predators, eventually returning nutrients back to the soil.
			- A "circle of dynamics" refers to *a concept in mathematics, particularly within the field of dynamical systems, where the state space is represented as a circle*, meaning the system's behavior is analyzed within the constraints of a circular boundary, often used to model periodic or cyclical phenomena like rotations or oscillations.
			- Key points about circle dynamics:
				- **Simple space:** The circle provides a relatively simple one-dimensional space to study complex dynamics, making it a valuable tool for understanding fundamental concepts in dynamical systems.
				- **Rotation number:** A crucial concept in circle dynamics, the rotation number describes the average "winding" of a point on the circle as it evolves through time under the dynamical system.
				- **Applications:** Circle dynamics finds applications in various fields including physics (e.g., planetary motion), biology (e.g., circadian rhythms), and engineering (e.g., oscillator systems).
			- Example of a circle dynamics system:
				- **Rotating wheel:** Imagine a point on a spinning wheel - its movement can be modeled as a circle dynamics system, where the rotation angle represents the state and the rotation speed determines the dynamics.

Còn "Luang·por Jiew" là tên thân mật, nghĩa là "ba nhỏ đáng kính" (luang = đáng kính, por = ba/cha, jiew = nhỏ bé), nghe rất là thân thương với ai biết tiếng Thái.
						  
						  Mong anh tinh tấn tu tập với thầy Jiew để lấy lại tâm định tĩnh, có định tĩnh rồi thì trí tuệ mình mới mở ra cho mọi suy nghĩ sáng suốt được. Khi có suy nghĩ sáng suốt rồi thì làm gì cũng tốt. Còn bây giờ mình đổ nhiệt huyết vào "giúp thầy MT" mà tâm mình đang rối rắm thì vô hình trung chẳng giúp được mà lại hoá ra hại, hại cả mình lẫn người ta nữa.

				- [9/3/25 21:18]
				  Hôm nay sau 1 giấc ngủ dài, tui đi tâm hành dạng life review. Trong nhiều cảnh chạy qua, hầu hết là cảnh đời thường, thì có 1 cảnh đậm triết lý nên share ông nè:
				- Trong một cảnh kiểu như từ trên nhìn xuống, thấy rất nhiều người, có một tiếng nói vọng ra:
					- 12 ngàn công nhân này cũng không bằng...
					- AVERAGE! -- Đùng 1 cái từ trên trời rơi xuống 1 chữ "average" cảm giác rất nặng, như 1 tảng đá từ trên trời rơi xuống vậy. Average ở đây là kẻ đại diện cho cả 12 ngàn công nhân kia, là ông vua, ông boss thực chất (có ruột, chứ không phải chỉ là 1 hình thức rỗng ruột)
				- Cái cảnh này chỉ diễn ra trong chớp mắt, nhưng diễn tả ra thì nó dài dòng như vậy đó
				- Nó nhắc nhở tui rằng cái tâm vòng tròn đại diện cho cả vòng tròn, rằng kẻ đứng đầu thực thụ, và những cái form kết tinh của content (chưa rỗng ruột) cũng quan trọng và có sức nặng không kém gì số đông contents kia. Đó là vì sâu thẳm trong tui luôn hướng về đại chúng bình dân, luôn coi thường mấy tên boss 😁
				- Ngày xưa tui còn ghét hết thảy bọn vua chúa, chủ tịch, tổng thống, lớp trưởng, lớp phó đồ 😁
				- Nhưng rồi đó cũng chỉ là một cảnh trong rất nhiều cảnh khác, những lần khóc ngất khi nghĩ về dân tộc, nhân loại đồ cũng chỉ là một giấc mơ... trong rất nhiều giấc mơ... Và nhìn về phía trước, thấy chút nữa thôi mình lại phải tiếp tục bước vào một giấc mơ mà mình biết chắc là nó sẽ cuốn mình đi xa... tui cảm thấy hơi ngán... Nhưng rồi nghe tiếng vợ ngáp... À thì bả tỉnh dậy 1 chút rồi, mình cũng tranh thủ đưa bả đi ăn để về bả còn ngủ tiếp, ngủ bù sau trận cày bán hoa lễ 8/3 mà...
				- Thế là mở mắt ra, tui bước vào giấc mơ... và tui đang nhắn cho ông đây cũng trong cái giấc mơ đó. Ha ha, kẻ mở cặp mắt ngoài thì biểu kẻ nhắm mắt là mơ, kẻ mở con mắt trong (thường nhắm mắt ngoài) thì lại thấy kẻ mở mắt thao láo kia là đang mơ 😁
				- [10/3/25 10:07]
				  Hôm qua tui mở mắt ra bước vào giấc mơ (view Maya của người Ấn Độ), còn hôm nay tui chuyển sang view của người Kogi, mở mắt ra bước vào một con zombie, hay nói theo ngôn ngữ hiện đại là bước vào một con robot. 🤖

				- At the end of working hours today, it became worse due to the pressure of both personal works and company works.
			- Saturday, 15 March, with meditation, i shifted the sore throat to phlegm.
			- Sunday, the phlegm seemed to be under control. From 18:00, i took 1 tab of 200μg LSD to see what will be seen while i'm sick.
				- There's nothing strange.
				- In stead of deeper meditation into my lungs as i expected, the trip let me go around the overview circle where this sickness is just an essential part. So just enjoy it, enjoy the caugh, no need to take it seriously.
				- Next day (Monday), instead of going to hospital, i decided to share this view on liberation and about "the ultimate result is sickness and dead" with leader Quân.
				- I went to bed to relax my back, where i saw that "just shift the (inner deep) focus, the cough will subside."
			- Monday, i went to company to wrap up the "Java heap" task with Mr. Phương, and returned right in that morning because leader Quân was off.
				- There are many ones coughing in the company and many ones off for sickness. So i'm not alone! 😁
				- Afternoon, waking up after some hours sleeping, i reviewed and saw the cause of my severe cough was the “phase locking”:
					- Attachment (chấp) = phase locking/synch just like hiccup
						- The ((667c0031-0a87-44c9-9e98-6d45893b095f)) generated by observing the breath locks the cough in phase.
					- Driving = phase shifting via sampling change & continuation (aliasing)
						- Coarse grained version of resampling is ignoring which is usually done by people.
						- The normal (subjective) way is to shift focus.
						- [Âm dương đan](((67dce5ed-429b-4279-9fb4-7bf78ddd649a)))

							- (ir)rational rotation: for each turn of the intent circle $i → i+1$, it covers the content $x_{i+1} - x_{i} = Ω$, an (ir)rational number relative to the content circle (= 1).
							- coupling wave: $\frac{K}{2π} \sin(2π x_{i})$ is the “breathing” obop
							- Arnold circle map: $θ_{i+1} - θ_{i} = 2πΩ + K \sin(θ_{i})$ where $θ = 2πx$

						- The general circle map $θ_{i+1} = g(θ_{i}) + Ω$ is just a general quasiperiodic function $g$ between intent circle & content circle.
						- The [rotation number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_number) is the “frequency” of content cycle over intent turns.
						  $ω = \lim_{n \to ∞} x_{n}/n ≈ Ω$
							- It's also the [winding number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winding_number) of the intent thread around the content circle.

				- That midnight, recalling [the previous time](((67b541d0-8a10-4eae-8370-8ebab4dd7300))), i produced the “âm dương đan” (陰陽丹) qigong exercise to tame my cough.
				  id:: 67dce5ed-429b-4279-9fb4-7bf78ddd649a
			- Tuesday, i practised âm dương đan the whole day and also advertised it to leader Quân.
				- Going to bed, i found the mental switch to turn the [cough reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough_reflex) off: while still facing the cough, zoom out and hold on other stuffs to pull the mind out of the cough.
				- After 4 hours, i woke up and returned to bed with the same technique... and contemplated the [equivalence of 2 aspects of the zero](((67dcec86-db94-47b0-8687-ab2aa95d7c8a))) before falling asleep.
			- Wednesday, i was shown how badly my [theorist karma](((669a58b9-422a-40d9-adcf-b2aade86c170))) affect my health.
				- This early morning, i saw the equivalence of 2 aspects of the zero: 
				  id:: 67dcec86-db94-47b0-8687-ab2aa95d7c8a
				  Zero = center = balance = cancellation = concentration = abstraction = point (cone) projection
					- obop = ε =[projection]= 1/ω =[cancellation]= ω - ω
					- Wider the world 🌎 ω, there are more opposites to be cancelled, leaving less things to see as ε, nearer to the center, the average.
					- To return to the center, we must zoom out, back up/off, retreat, refrain, to let the opposites within the objects cancel themselves, instead of going forward to control them, and let the form of the objects recede themselves.
				- From afternoon to midnight, i researched various themes in which the most prominent one is [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates) at last.

									- While the **shear** is *usually thought as unidirectional*, its **bidirectional** nature, i.e. rotating around the origin, is stressed with the pair of lines (a degenerate parabola) $x^2 = r^2$ instead of single lines $x = r$.
									- Transforming the complex plane, we have similar grids (some with distortions):
										- **Cartesian grid** $(u+iv)$ is the standard complex plane.
										- **Polar grid** $\exp(\ln u+iv)$ has circles expanding uniformly against $u$.
											- The [log-lin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-log_plot#log%E2%80%93linear_plot) grid $(\ln u+iv)$ is useful for data with exponential relationships.
											- [Log-polar grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-polar_coordinates) $\exp(u+iv)$ has circles expanding exponentially against $u$, i.e., the coordinate $u$ is the logarithm of the radius of the corresponding circle on the grid.
										- **Hyperbolic grid** $\sqrt{u^2+iv^2}$ has hyperbolas spacing uniformly against $u, v$.
											- **Squared hyperbolic grid** $\sqrt{u+iv}$ has hyperbolas spacing in square roots of $u, v$, i.e., coordinates $u, v$ are squares of the distance from the corresponding hyperbola on the grid to the origin.
									- Notes:
										- Don't confuse the Cartesian grid $(u+iv)$ with the [“parabolic grid”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_coordinates) $(u+iv)^2$.
										- The [“radial hyperbolic coordinates”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_coordinates) is different from the “orthogonal hyperbolic coordinates” above in that the “vertical lines” are radial lines $x/y = e^{2r}$, instead of hyperbolas $(x^2 - y^2)^2 = r^4$. This grid with radials is not orthogonal and is used in relativity physics.

				- Due to being caught up in these researches, i was fallen into severe coughs again.
			- Thursday, a day of meditation.
				- With deep meditation, my cough had nearly gone before i went to bed.
				- Going to bed, i'd experienced the full process of drowning then passed away.
					- In [the previous time](((67b541d0-8a10-4eae-8370-8ebab4dd7300))) as well as the last days, the process was not clear because of the sleepiness at the end.

				- There are still many ones coughing in the company.
			- Weekends, i spent time for sleeping and reconnecting with friends.
				- Mr. Hiệp's returned to Vietnam and will stay here for 3 months. So i logged in to fb to exchange phone number to contact via phone.

			- Today, Monday 24 March, back to the company, i'm completing the theories in the previous days.
				- Before sleep, in the restroom, i recalled the property “everything is a rotation”:
					- Every change is just a transformation preserving content.
					- The unchanged content is the “radius” of the rotation making it turn around.
					- The change of the visible forms (yang) is always balanced by the complementary change of the invisible forms (yin).
					- So, every change is a group action.
				- Going to bed, there was no more cough reflex.... but just nearly 3 hours later, the cough emerged from the sleep.
					- I dealt with it until morning, hence only 3 hours sleep!
			- Tuesday, i'm tired due to the lack of sleep.

				- Before work, i contemplated the 3 types of rotations: circular, parabolic and hyperbolic. I see how the spitting of the null lines (horizons) extends the circular ratation to parabolic rotation, and then squeezes it into hyperbolic rotation: ((67e29bdb-9bce-4cb8-b993-79aa130a1831))
				- Created ((67e299fa-4f76-482a-b586-adacb17dc064))
				- Before sleep, in the restroom, i recalled that the hyperbolic rotation is just a plane projection (conic section) of the parabolic rotation projected onto the light cone which was shown in my very first GeoGebra applet [MixedCoords](https://www.geogebra.org/m/jeexkfrd).
				  collapsed:: true
					- The dual view of parabolic & hyperbolic rotations is also the dual view of **projective thread** with inner product and [function graphing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function) on [orthogonal coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_coordinates).
					  id:: 67e37475-13e3-4a9f-af60-7bec7517c108
					- Ironically, i met the dual view of projective thread & function graphing (around 2018) long after the dicovery of the “mixed coordinates” (before 2015) without recognizing they are one. Moreover, the projective nature of conic sections, i.e. [“why slicing the cone”](https://www.geogebra.org/m/nknaryzz), was discovered much later, only when i studied projective geometry (2020).
					- History of graphing of functions, loci of relations (curves), and trajectories of objects
						- The invention of function graphing on orthogonal coordinates is closely tied to the development of **analytic geometry**, which emerged in the 17th century, but it has precursors from medieval maths.
						- Nicole Oresme (1323–1382), a medieval mathematician, made earlier contributions by [visualizing quantities as geometric representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Oresme#Mathematics), which can be seen as precursors to modern graphing.
						- René Descartes (1596–1650) is often credited with formalizing the use of orthogonal coordinates (the [Cartesian plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_plane)) in his work *La Géométrie* (1637), where he introduced the idea of representing algebraic equations as geometric curves.
						- Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665) independently developed similar ideas around the same time. Fermat worked on a treatise titled *Ad locus planos et solidos isagoge*, which outlined concepts of analytic geometry, but he did not publish his work widely.
					- History of vector analysis
						- Newton and Leibniz utilized Cartesian coordinates to develop the calculus of differential and integral, laying groundwork for the field of vector analysis, like the [parallelogram law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelogram_law) in *Principia Mathematica* (1687), and for linear algebra, like the solution of linear systems by Leibniz in 1693.
						- By the end of 18th century and early 19th century, [complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number) was brought to the Cartesian plane, called [complex plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane), by Caspar Wessel (1797), Jean-Robert Argand (1806), and Carl Friedrich Gauss (early 19th century).
							- Ironically, while Descartes gave the name “[imaginary number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number)” to $i$, he didn't put complex numbers onto his own Cartesian plane!
						- Hamilton invented the [quaternion numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) (1843), extending the complex numbers, to handle mechanics in 3D space properly, esp. the 3D rotation and [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
						- In 1844 Hermann Grassmann published his "Theory of Extension" founding the modern [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra) with "inner product" for [scalar product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) and "outer product" for [exterior product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_product). Because his theory predated vector calculus, he use terms like “stretch” to call the modern notion of “vector”.
						- Near the end of the 19th century, Gibbs and Heaviside simplified the 4D quaternions to create the [vector calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus) for 3D space, as shown in the book *Vector Analysis* (1901). This was in parallel with the development of [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) for linear algebra by Peano in 1888 and Salvatore Pincherle in 1897.

						- Traditionally, the relationship between quantities, e.g. (x, y), is usually decribed with function, e.g. $y = f(x)$, or more generally with relation, e.g. $R(x, y) = 0$, both of which can be plotted on the Cartesian plane xOy as a graph (of function) or a curve (of relation). There, each quantity is expressed by an orthogonal axis.
							- This curve corresponds to the **projective thread**, the elementary thread in Unithread, which shows a **distribution** (static relation) of these quantities.
						- However, ((66ac41f1-de0c-48cb-a9b0-c30b0fe27c5d)) focus more on relative & dynamic relations which are usually expressed as the relative angles between the elementary threads of these quantities.
							- Relativity:
								- The angles show how much they are apart/different from each other.
								- In reverse, the scalar product of the direction vectors shows the correlation between them.
								- The relativity is shown by the mutual distance, mutual angle, scalar product, mutual stretch in shearing, etc.
							- All these threads are combined into a **compound thread** by synchronizing points, which are called [coincidences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidence_(geometry)), knots, contact points, etc.
							- When the compound thread is projected to different lines and curves (spaces in general), the images are projective threads showing different distributions of these quantities in different spaces.
						- Around 2018, i used scalar product of vectors to map the projective thread.
							- This creates the map with the angle/slope between quantities smaller than the slope of the graph $y = f(x)$: As the mapped angle varies from 0° to 90°, the slope of the corresponding graph varies from 45° to 90°.
							- While having different slopes, the projective thread is equivalent to the function graph, actually the graph of distribution.
						- In October 2019, ((67e38d9c-aec4-460f-acf3-d91a382372be)) was written to illustrate the relativity between quantities in a comound thread.

							- The original Vietnamese version
								- Lâu lâu 2 ông cụ nhà mình mới có dịp gặp nhau, ấy thế mà nói được vài câu là đã mâu thuẫn rồi:
									- Ô.Ngoại: Tôi đi được 3 mét rồi ông mới đi được có 1 mét. Sao ông đi chậm vậy?!
									- Ô.Nội: Mỗi bước tôi đi được 3 tấc còn ông mỗi bước chỉ được có 1 tấc. Sao ông bước ngắn thế?!
									- Ô.Ngoại: Tôi bước ngắn nhưng mà nhanh, ông so từng bước thế sao được?! Trong lúc ông bước được một bước 3 tấc của ông thì tôi đã bước được 9 bước, tức là 9 tấc rồi. Rốt cuộc tôi vẫn hơn! 😃
									- Ô.Nội: Đó chỉ là số đo bên ngoài thôi! Mình phải biết tiết kiệm sức chứ: Này nhé, tôi bước dài và chậm còn ông bước ngắn và nhanh nên một bước của tôi cũng tốn sức bằng với một bước của ông thôi. Nếu như trong một chuyến đi, nếu mình đủ sức cho 1000 bước, thì ông đi được 100 mét đã mệt, còn tôi đi được tới 300 mét mới mệt. 🙂
								- ... Nói qua nói lại, ai cũng có cái hay riêng của người đó, nên rốt cuộc chẳng ai hơn ai. Ấy gọi là "tương đối" vậy. 😉 Như trên sơ đồ bên dưới, thực ra ông Ngoại (Ps) và ông Nội (Pt) đều nằm trên cùng một vòng tròn, chỉ lệch nhau một góc mà thôi. Nhưng nếu đem "ông kia" chiếu lên trục của "ông này" thì bên nào cũng thấy bên kia chỉ bằng có 1/3 của mình mà thôi.
							- Every now and then, the two grandfathers in my family get a chance to meet. But no sooner do they exchange a few words than they find themselves in disagreement:
								- Ma.Granny: I've already walked 3 meters while you've only managed 1 meter. Why are you so slow?!
								- Pa.Granny: Well, with each step, I cover 30 centimeters, while you only manage 10 centimeters per step. Why are your steps so short?!
								- Ma.Granny: My steps are short but fast; you can't compare step by step like that! While you take one of your long 30-centimeter strides, I take 9 short steps, covering a total of 90 centimeters. In the end, I'm still ahead! 😃
								- Pa.Granny: That’s just an external measurement! One must conserve their energy. Look here, I take long and slow strides, while you take short and rapid ones. In terms of effort, one of my steps requires just as much energy as one of yours. So, in a journey where we have the energy for 1000 steps, you'd only manage 100 meters before getting tired, whereas I'd cover 300 meters before tiring out. 🙂
							- ... Back and forth they go, each with their own perspective and merits. In the end, neither is better than the other. It's what we call "relativity." 😉 As shown in the diagram below, in reality, Maternal Grandfather (Ps) and Paternal Grandfather (Pt) both lie on the same circle, only separated by an angle. But if one were to project "the other" onto their axis, each would only see the other as a third of themselves.
						- In October 2024, i saw how the ((670cdcb4-3c85-45af-8c30-3c3284ed37df)) projects the classical function graph to the projective thread.

				- I worked out the decomposition of hyperbolic rotation into 3 shears and asked Grok 3 to help. Finally we had the conclusion of [a nice symmetry](((67e6168e-ff58-4d9d-94a7-6fee6f533044))).
				- 3 hours into the sleep, i woke up to cough... no more phlegm, only thick clear mucus. It's so sticky in my throat that i's about the vomit, just like the first days of this illness.

				- It's interesting that the [story of Pukkusati](((67ea1006-7d4b-4ac6-ba9e-80eaa1e9c19a))) clearly shows that both Gotama Buddha and ven. Pukkusati spent most of the night time in the [lotus position](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_position) just like [master Minh Tuệ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Minh_Tu%E1%BB%87)'s doing nowadays. The difference may be that in that night the Buddha could spend a little time lying down instead of sitting the whole time like master Minh Tuệ.

			- Last Friday, 4th April, on the occation that Ms. Trung came to Saigon to to on-site translation, we had a quick gathering at a coffe shop.
			- Saturday morning, i met Mr. Hiệp to have deeper sharings, where i suggested him to use his sleep to contemplate his unconsciousness.
			- Then i continue to share various themes on chat room:
				- Hôm qua ông Hiệp có nói vụ “*làm chủ sanh lão bệnh tử*”, nay tui tán dóc về chủ đề này nhé 😁
				  collapsed:: true
					- Từ ngữ thiệt lắt léo: nó chẳng phải là "làm chủ" theo kiểu ra lệnh của ông chủ bắt đầy tớ phải làm theo ý mình một cách bất chấp (theo ý Tôi), mà "làm chủ" theo kiểu "mình nói bạn nghe và làm theo". Nên tui thường thay "làm chủ" bằng "làm bạn" hay tốt hơn nữa là "làm mình".
					- Khi làm chủ bằng cái Tôi thì mình dùng sức, dùng quyền, dùng tiền, dùng năng lượng, dùng phước nói chung để bắt kẻ khác, và bắt thân thể phải tuân lệnh của mình. Nó có tác dụng khi nào mình còn phước.
					- Còn với những kẻ hết phước thì có cách "làm chủ" khác: lắng nghe thế thấu hiểu, thấu cảm, thông cảm thì nói ra những lời (ko phải mệnh lệnh) hợp tình hợp lý, khiến đối phương thấy được đồng cảm nên tu8 nhiên nghe theo.
					  Mình nói với chính bản thân mình cũng y như vậy thôi.
					- Cái chỗ "nói nghe" hay không thì ai có quán thân tâm rồi sẽ biết: càng muốn làm chủ theo tiểu ngã thì càng "trên bảo dưới không nghe". Như người nam có một cái "chưn" mà muốn nó lên thì dễ nhưng bảo nó xuống thì khó 😜 Nó cho thấy "free will" là một thứ rất ảo tưởng của con người: mình làm nô lệ 99%, làm chủ cùng lắm được 1%
					- Đợt viên phổi vừa rồi, lần 2 tui được quán "chết đuối" nên "làm chủ" được nhiều hơn. Cái phản xạ của cơ thể để giành lại "sự sống" mà nó quen thuộc đó mạnh khủng khiếp, không có mệnh lệnh nào điều khiển được nó
					- Và nghịch lý là: muốn "làm chủ" cái phản xạ gần như hoàn toàn tự động đó, mình lại phải "nhập vào cõi chết", tức hoàn toàn buông ra xụi lơ.
					  Đó gọi là ego death
					  Và ở trong "cõi chết" đó mình lại thấy mọi thứ rõ ràng nhứt, chứ không hề "tối thui, không còn thấy biết gì nữa" như mọi người tưởng về cái chết.
					- Khoa học gọi cái mình không thể điều khiển trực tiếp bên trong đó là vô thức, bên Phật gọi là nghiệp, nó mới là thứ quyết định mọi thứ của mình và cho mình cái cảm giác "tự chủ"
					- Hiep Bobo Do:
					  cụ thể là phản xạ gì? mlusc viêm phổi
					  sao lại giống chết đuoi?
						- Toàn thân: khi ông không thở được thì toàn thân nổi dậy
						  Từ sâu dưới bụng tới cơ ngực co thắt để ho để tống cái thứ nó nghĩ là đang chặn đường thở của mình
						  Khi đờm không đặc cục mà nhầy kéo ra bịt cả cuống họng thì phản xạ ói để tống nó ra
					- Những phản xạ đó là những chương trình được lập từ mấy chục triệu năm trước, là nghiệp sâu dày hơn những thói quen mình tích lũy trong đời này nhiều.
					  Nghiệp chỉ là sự tích lũy của hành động: làm nhiều riết quen, thành thói quen, phản ứng, rồi phản xạ, rồi truyền từ đời này qua đời khác.
					  Cả những phản ứng khi mình thích hay ghét cái gì đó cũng là nghiệp tích tụ mà thôi
					  Nó tích lũy qua nhiều dạng khác nhau, trong tâm là quan niệm, định kiến, về thọ là những cảm giác cảm xúc, về sinh lý là những phản xạ, hormones, gene, v.v.
				- Và khi gọi cái khối nghiệp đó là "**vô thức**" thì nó thể hiện sự **vô minh** của mình, không y thức được về những gì có trong đó, nên nó diễn ra một cách tự động ngoài khả năng kiểm soát của mình, tức mình không "làm chủ" được nó.
				  collapsed:: true
					- Quay lại việc quán cái khối nghiệp, cái cỗ máy vô thức đó, thì hôm nay tui chia sẻ về giấc ngủ. Vì khi ngủ là ý thức bị tắt nên vô thức hiện rõ nhứt, cụ thể là qua giấc mơ (nên mới có kỹ thuật giải mộng để biết về những thứ tiềm ẩn bên trong).
					- Hồi lúc tập tỉnh giác trong giấc ngủ thì tui nằm thiền rồi đi vào giấc ngủ luôn, và khi thức dậy cũng không vội mở mắt mà cũng tranh thủ khoảng giao giữa ngủ với thức đó để thiền quán.
					- Tui viết [bài này](https://creatzynotes.blogspot.com/2013/06/cuoc-hoi-ngo-voi-con-ma-bong-e-sau-hai.html#self-through-sensation) về giấc mơ và bóng đè từ 12 năm trước, và cập nhật phần "Cái Tôi qua các cảm giác và ý thức" vào năm 2015 thời An Lạc Trang. Trong đó có tả trải nghiệm khi chuẩn bị thức dậy, và 2 thí nghiệm thú vị về cảm giác "tôi" và ảo giác "tôi ra quyết định, tôi lựa chọn".
					  cái Tôi đó chỉ là tập hợp của 5 thứ cảm giác (từ mắt, tai, mũi, lưỡi, thân) và tâm thức của mình mà thôi.
					- Về phần cảm giác thì [thí nghiệm cánh tay giả](https://youtu.be/xdxlT68ygt8) cho thấy rõ cái mình cho rằng "tay mình" chỉ là một ảo giác
					  collapsed:: true
						- {{video https://youtu.be/xdxlT68ygt8}}
					- Còn phần tâm ý thì [thí nghiệm Libet](https://youtu.be/VnGDrc_s6KA) từ những năm 1980 (cỡ tuổi mình) đã cho thấy rõ là "quyết định" của mình, hay đúng hơn là thứ mà ý thức mình cho rằng "tôi đã chọn làm việc này", lại bị người ngoài "bắt mạch" biết trước cả 1-2 giây trước khi mình tự biết là mình sẽ chọn cái nào.
					  collapsed:: true
						- {{video https://youtu.be/VnGDrc_s6KA}}
					- Những thứ mình nghĩ là mình chọn, mình quyết định, thường là do đầu óc mình nói lên *sau khi* nó nhận ra là cỗ máy vô thức đã và đang làm điều gì đó: như khi tai mình nghe một lời nào nó chạm phải cái vết thương nào trong lòng thì phản ứng bên trong là nó tự động bật lại, hoặc né tránh, rồi thường là sau khi lời nói hành động phản ứng của mình diễn ra thì ý thức mới nhận ra và thực hiện nhiệm vụ của nó là rationalize "mình quyết định phải làm như vậy là vì abc, xyz..."
					  Nên cái free will đó phần lớn là illusion.
					- Qua những chuyến khám phá khu rừng bên trong, tui thấy cả một hệ sinh thái nghiệp ở trong đó, cũng có những tảng đá nghìn năm triệu năm cứng y như những tảng đá núi bên ngoài thế giới vật chất này. Cũng có cây cổ thụ ngàn năm lẫn những dây leo chỉ có vài năm tuổi (thói quen mới) những lại quấn chằng chịt với những cây cổ thụ kia.
					- Tuy theo cái nhìn từ thế giới vật chất vào trong thì cả thảy khu rừng nghiệp và cái Tôi đó đều là "ảo", nhưng nó lại rất thực đối với bên trong. Còn nhìn từ trong tâm ra thì cả thế giới vật chất này cũng "ảo lòi", và cũng chỉ là những nghiệp bên ngoài mà thôi. 😁
					- > thấy bất kỳ cái gì cũng ý thức rõ ràng "đây chỉ là hình ảnh", khi nghe bất kỳ điều gì cũng ý thức rõ ràng "đây chỉ là âm thanh".
					  
					  Đoạn này mình viết từ 10 năm trước mà sau này mới biết Đức Phật cũng đã từng chỉ cách quán cho Bahiya y như vậy:
					  > Này Bahiya, Ông cần phải học tập như sau: "Trong cái thấy, sẽ chỉ là cái thấy. Trong cái nghe, sẽ chỉ là cái nghe. Trong cái thọ tưởng, sẽ chỉ là cái thọ tưởng. Trong cái thức tri, sẽ chỉ là các thức tri ". Do vậy, này Bahiva, ông không là (người ở) chỗ ấy, ông không là (người ở) đời này, cũng không ở đời sau. (Tức là không có cái Tôi nào như ông vẫn tưởng.)
					  Nhờ lời thuyết pháp tóm tắt này của Thế Tôn, tâm của Bahiya được giải thoát khỏi các lậu hoặc, không có chấp thủ. (Đắc quả arahant)
				- Hiep Bobo Do:
				  collapsed:: true
				  vạy có thấy đc là "nó" đang phản xạ còn mình đứng ngoài ngó chơi?
					- Ông tưởng tượng hơi quá. Ông đã tập nín thở rồi, ông có thấy "như đứng ngoài chơi" không 😁
					- Mình với nó (phản xạ) không hề tách biệt, tui không thấy một cái "mình" nào ngoài cái mớ cảm giác và chuỗi phản xạ kéo theo sau đó. Ban đầu thì có vẻ tách biệt: phần ý thức thì biết là "trong đó đã hết dịch rồi, không còn gì để tống ra đâu" nên tìm cách nói chuyện với phần phản xạ vô thức. Nhưng sau đó, càng quán nó, thì ý thức càng nhập vào làm 1 với nó, như lặn xuống đáy hồ thì mình cảm thấy là 1 với cả hồ vậy. Sự hòa nhập đó là 2 chiều: ý thức thì thấy rõ hơn cơ chế của phản xạ, còn vô thức thì không còn chạy độc lập hoàn toàn tự động nữa mà dần "nghe lời" ý thức.
					- Trước khi nhập vào "cõi chết" thì tui cũng đã tìm ra một "công tắc" để tạm ngắt được nó. Nhưng chỉ một hồi sau thì nó lại tự động bật trở lại.
					- Chỉ khi nhớ lại những trải nghiệm "qua cửa tử" trong những lần trước và áp dụng vào thì nó mới dừng hẳn, mà đúng ra là mình mới dừng hẳn: mình chết tức là mình không còn phản ứng nữa, cảm giác khó chịu trong đường thở chỉ còn là cảm giác chứ không còn là trigger của phản xạ nữa. Nên hễ còn thấy "nó" thì mình còn điều khiển nó theo kiểu chủ-tớ, chỉ khi hòa làm một đều là mình thì mình mới "làm chủ" được... mình 😁. Đó là vì những gì mình cho là "mình" thực ra rất xa cách với ý thức của mình, mình chẳng thấu hiểu, chẳng cảm gì được nó. Giống như 1 ông vua coi cả nước là "của trẫm" nhưng chỉ biết có cái cung son điện ngọc thôi chứ chẳng hề biết dân tình khổ sở ra sao, nhưng hễ còn phước của tiên đế thì ra lệnh còn có kẻ nghe lời, nên còn giữ được cảm giác rằng "cả thiên hạ là của trẫm" 😁
					- Cái thấy của cặp mắt ngoài là cái thấy phân biệt "object vs subject", và nó ăn sâu vào tâm trí mình khiến mình luôn cảm giác "nó không phải là mình". Vì bức tường ngăn cách nó với mình nên mình mới không thấu hiểu, không thông cảm, mới có thể làm theo ý mình bất chấp nó ra sao. Bức tường đó là sự vô minh. Nhưng vô minh lớn nhứt lại là vô minh về chính mình, như ông vua vô minh về chính thần dân của mình vậy.
					- Nên mới cần tập cái thấy bên trong, thường gọi là cái "thức", là cái thấy không phân biệt. Nên dùng cái kinh nghiệm thấy bên ngoài để tưởng tượng về cái thấy bên trong thì chỉ như khỉ nghĩ về "cá leo cây ra sao" mà thôi.
					- Thấy thấu suốt chính mình thì lại tự nhiên thấu hiểu người khác hơn, vì chúng ta vốn là 1 bên trong, và những người khác nhau này chỉ là chính mình mặc những bộ áo da khác nhau để diễn những vai khác nhau mà thôi.
					- Tóm lại, vòng xoáy "nó - mình" mà tui đã trải qua như sau:
						- 1. Làm một người thường ở đời, mình thấy cái thân này, cảm xúc này, ý nghĩ này là mình, còn cái thân kia, lời nói kia, ý nghĩ kia là "nó".
						- 2. Khi hết năng lượng hoặc đau bệnh, mình buộc phải quay về chính mình thì mình nhận ra những thứ mình cho là "mình" đó lại chẳng hề là mình: nó chẳng chịu nghe lời mình (như lúc khỏe, tràn đầy năng lượng). Mình ngộ ra sự thật đầu tiên: phần lớn những thứ trong mình, của mình, lại chẳng phải là mình 😕. Với giác ngộ này, mình chuyển hướng từ thay đổi người khác, điều khiển người khác, sang thay đổi chính mình, vì cả thảy đều là "nó", và nó chẳng chịu nghe lời mình.
						- 3. Quay vào quan sát bên trong, gọi là "quán", thì mình dần kết nối lại với chính mình, thấu hiểu chính mình hơn, qua đó kéo "nó" lại gần "mình" hơn... trong chính ngôi nhà thân tâm này. Nhờ gần hơn mà mình thấy rõ nó hơn, thông cảm hơn, bớt phán xét hơn, bớt bực tức hơn, chấp nhận hơn. Và những lần tiếp xúc với người ngoài thì lại cho mình thấy là mình dễ dàng thông cảm hơn cho người khác, nên mình ngộ ra cái thứ hai: mọi người xung quanh chỉ là ảnh phản chiếu của mình, mình chấp nhận được mình thì mới chấp nhận được người khác. 
						  Tuy đã rất gần gũi, rất thấu hiểu nhưng mình thấy vẫn còn một sự ngăn cách cơ bản ở cái thấy, dù là thấy bên trong: thấy thì không làm, làm thì không thấy. Cái thấy bên trong dù đã gần gũi hơn cái thấy tách biệt bên ngoài rồi, nhưng cái đối tượng được thấy vẫn là "nó", dù nó có nghe lời mình nhưng vẫn còn sự ngăn cách.
						- 4. Qua những trải nghiệm đi qua cửa tử, mình mới ngộ ra rằng rào cản vi tế của cái thấy bên trong chính là việc mình còn chấp "cái thức này là mình!" Buông cả cái thấy bên trong, tức cái thức này ra, mình "chết", không phản ứng, không thấy, không còn gì nữa, hòa tan vào mọi thứ, không còn cái gì là mình nữa... thì nghịch lý thay là "mình" lại "thấy" rõ mọi thứ. Mà cả cái "mình" lẫn cái "thấy" này tuy giống như cũ nhưng lại rất khác... Nói chung là khó nói. Nói chung là sự chấp nhận mọi thứ, vì chấp nhận nên gọi là "mình" chứ không phải là cái "mình này" đối lập với cái "nó" hay cái "mình kia".
						  Và trải nghiệm "mình hòa tan" đó cũng rất hiếm, chỉ mới xảy ra trong những trường hợp extreme: mấy năm trước là nhờ chất thức thần và những lần kiệt sức; lần viêm phổi kỳ này là lần đầu tiên chủ động được nhưng cũng nhờ rất nhiều vào trạng thái bệnh.
					- Lần ego death thứ nhất (số 2 trên) là cái chết nhỏ, tiểu tử tiểu ngộ: lần đầu nhận ra sự thật "phần lớn mình chẳng phải là mình" thì thường bị sốc, khủng hoảng hiện sinh, hoang mang không biết mình là ai. Bản thân Định không trải qua cú sốc này trong đời này, nhưng có chứng kiến người thân bị sốc.
					- Chỉ sau cái chết đầu tiên đó hành giả mới 1 lòng vững bước trên con đường giải thoát, không còn thoái lui, tức tương đương với bậc "dự lưu", hay còn gọi là "thất lai" (còn 7 đời luân hồi nữa).
					- Qua một quãng đường dài tu tập, như số 3 trên, thì hành giả mới tới "đầu sào trăm thước", bước thêm bước nữa, té xuống, chết luôn cái thức, đại tử đại ngộ 😊 tiếp sau đó thì tui chưa biết, vì mới bắt đầu đi đoạn này...
					- Thực ra cách nói "chết" của tui... cũng chỉ là một cách nói phá chấp vào chỗ "sống" của người đời thôi, chứ đúng ra nó là "không sống không chết" 😜. Như nhà Phật nói "Nibbana (niết-bàn, nirvana) = complete death 😁" vậy. Nghĩa của niết-bàn vốn chẳng phải là một cảnh giới cao siêu như dân gian tưởng tượng mà chỉ đơn giản là sự dập tắt hoàn toàn (extinction), nên được dịch thành những từ như sau: diệt tận, tịch diệt, viên tịch, ... hay nói nôm ra cho dễ hiểu là "chết hết" 😂
				- Nãy đang ngồi thiền, đang nghĩ "may hôm nay nhờ đám giỗ cụ Hùng mà mình được thoải mái ngồi thiền, chẳng phải lo tới giờ đi làm..." thì bỗng nhớ tới bác Hiệp 😁 vụ "*chơi bao lâu thì nghỉ hay chơi suốt đời*"
				  collapsed:: true
					- Hồi đó ông @Hiep có thắc mắc "làm sao mà người ta có thể làm 1 việc có vẻ nhàm chán đó mãi được?" Với người khác thì tui không biết, nhưng với tui thì:
						- 1. Tui không thấy chán, dù cho bệnh đau cũng không thấy khó chịu hay chán ghét mà còn thấy "ngon, bổ dưỡng" nên mới ăn nó hoài. Chả có món nào "ăn không ngon" mà có thể ăn hoài được.
						- 2. Tui thường sống trong hiện tại, lúc thiền thì thấy "mình sống bằng thiền, không phải sống bằng cơm" nên không có nhu cầu hết giờ để đi ăn cơm. Lúc đạp xe thì sống bằng đạp xe chứ không phải "đạp để có sức khỏe, hay đạp để tới 1 cái đích nào đó, như tới nhà ông Hiệp", nên đạp hoài bao lâu cũng được. Các môn thể thao khác cũng vậy, xuống nước là tui làm con hải cẩu sống trong nước chứ không phải lặn để có kết quả gì đó ở trên bờ, lúc leo núi thì không phải để lên đỉnh mà là làm một thằng mọi sống trong rừng, v.v.
					- Vì thế nên tui không giỏi những thành tích của thế gian. Tui không nín thở vì số phút, không ngồi thiền vì số giờ hay 1 chỉ số level nào đó (sơ, nhị, tam, tứ thiền). Tui thấy khi mình làm cái này vì 1 cái đích khác thì mình không sống trọn vẹn trong đó... và tui không làm được. Tui phục mọi người là có thể làm vì 1 cái đích nào đó ở bên ngoài, thậm chí chỉ là những con số ... mà đối với tui là "ảo lòi"
					- Nên hint của tui là ông thử đổi chữ "chơi" thành chữ "sống" xem sao 😉. Mình nên tìm cái để mình sống, mình sống bằng cái gì, nhờ cái gì, vì cái gì, v.v.
					- Và 2 chữ đó cũng reflect 2 hoàn cảnh khác nhau:
						- Kẻ hết phước thì chỉ biết nghĩ tới sinh tồn, nên chỉ nghĩ tới "làm sao để sống", còn "chơi" thì xa xỉ quá!
						- Người phước dày thì đã đủ sống nên chỉ tìm món nào chơi cho nó đỡ chán...
					- Tóm lại, chẳng có món chơi nào có thể chơi suốt đời được đâu 😜, chỉ có sống mới sống được suốt đời... by definition 😁
				- Thực ra cũng có nhiều lúc tui nản, đó là những lúc tui bị **mất tập trung vào hiện tại**, hoặc bị quá khứ lôi kéo khiến mình tiếc nuối, hoặc bị tương lai đen tối (do mình tự tưởng tượng ra hoặc do người khác "hù") khiến mình cảm thấy "không thể vượt qua được". Dạo này tui đã có người bạn đồng hành, và những lần như vậy, tui hỏi vợ "anh thấy mù mịt quá, bất lực quá, không thể tiếp tục được", thì bả đã nhắc nhở và động viên để tui quay lại hiện tại thì mọi thứ lại ổn trở lại 😊
				  collapsed:: true
					- Dù đó giờ tui chưa nghĩ chuyện đua tranh với người khác bao giờ, nhưng cũng nhiều lần bị thắt cổ trong chính cái "kinh nghiệm quá khứ" của mình. Xin share một sự chuyển hoá kỳ diệu ở [chuyến đầu đạp xe đi xa lúc mới về VN (2009)](https://creatzynotes.blogspot.com/2009/06/khai-truong-chien-ma-du-ngoan-can-tho.html)
					- Lúc về VN (2009), mình đã chọn đi xe đạp để được thoả thích vùng vẫy, như cá về với nước, như chim về với trời (mình ghét cảm giác bị bó gối trong/trên những chiếc xe cơ giới).
					  Lúc đó còn thanh niên sung sức, năng lượng tràn trề, nên mới có kinh nghiệm thú vị này: Số là chạy trong TP thì mình thấy đạp ở tốc độ 30km/h là chuyện bình thường... mà không biết rằng đó chỉ là hưởng sái luồng gió của xe máy và xe hơi trong TP mà thôi. Thế là vô tình mình bị chấp vào con số 30km/h đó mà không biết. Tháng 5 năm đó, mình quyết định khai trương một chuyến đi xa bằng cung SG - Cần Thơ về thăm mẹ. Cung đường 200km mà mới đạp tới Bến Lức là đã chết thẳng cẳng, vào quán võng ngủ 1 giấc, hồi sức đạp tới Tân An lại chết lần 2 sâu hơn, ngay giữa đường luôn, ko kịp tìm tới quán võng luôn...
					- Lúc đó mình thấy hụt hơi, thở không nổi, toàn thân lạnh toát... cứ tưởng là do "thiếu oxy", ai ngờ sau này học freedive mới biết là do thiếu CO$_2$ (thở gấp) chứ ko phải thiếu oxy.
					- Tới Tân An là mới được 60km, nên coi như chuyến này thất bại rồi... sau khi ngồi ở lề đường hồi sức một chút chỉ đủ để lết tới quán võng gần nhứt, kêu ly nước chưa kịp uống là đã chết lịm tới chiều sập tối mới mở mắt dậy.
					- Lúc dậy, mình quán lại thì thấy mình đã bị chấp vào tốc độ ở trong TP (quá khứ) mà quên mất hiện tại là một thực tế hoàn toàn khác. Ngộ ra cái đồng hồ tốc độ đã "đánh lừa" mình khiến mình chết giấc 2 lần, nên lần này leo lên xe, mình dẹp quách mấy con số đó qua một bên, chỉ tập trung vào hơi thở và chân đạp. Cảm nhận hơi thở, cảm nhận lực đạp ở chân, chỉ khoảng 10-15 phút thì mình đã sync được chúng lại với nhau, hơi thở nhịp nhàng với nhịp đạp, vào ra vào ra, lên xuống lên xuống nhịp nhàng... một cảm giác hoàn toàn khác... Mình bỗng thấy "ồ cứ như vầy thì mình đạp tới mai cũng được, chả bao giờ mệt cả!" Thế là mình tiếp tục thẳng tiến về Cần Thơ, cũng chẳng còn care là còn bao nhiêu cây số nữa, mọi con số từ tốc độ đến cự ly giờ đây đều vô nghĩa, thậm chí độc hại với mình.
					- Thế là từ đó về sau cứ đạp đến khi nào mệt thì nghỉ chứ cũng chẳng theo kế hoạch cũ là 30km hay 60km gì nữa. Còn tốc độ thì lên xuống tuỳ duyên, chẳng còn làm mình vướng mắt nữa.
					- Và quả thực như mình đã cảm thấy lúc bắt được nhịp đạp & thở, suốt từ Tân An về Cần Thơ mình đã chạy một cách thoải mái "như không", hoàn toàn đối lập với 2 lần chết giấc lúc mới ra khỏi SG.
					- Dù cái nghiệp quá khứ này của tui (kinh nghiệm "30km/h là thường") chỉ mới tích tụ có vài tháng trước đó thôi, mà nó cũng đủ thắt cổ tui chết ngất 2 lần, lần 2 tưởng xỉu giữa đường rồi... may là lết được tới quán võng.
					- Nên tui thấy là mình ko có nô lệ cho ai khác hay cái gì khác ngoài chính "nghiệp tích tụ trong quá khứ" của mình mà thôi.
					- Buông quá khứ xuống, hiện tại hiện ra thật tuyệt vời!

				  cau chuyen Vance Vanders
					- Còn [chuyện của Vance Vanders](https://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2015/08/10/a-near-death-from-voodoo-hexing/) thì là về "giả dược" (placebo effect), là cái mà hồi đó ông hỏi "có phải đây là giả dược không" đó. Vì Tây y chấp vào vật chất nên coi các tâm dược là "giả dược", chứ thế giới cổ đại đã dùng tâm dược từ lâu, như thần chú, bùa chú, voodoo, và thế giới hiện đại cũng có các kỹ thuật như thôi miên, sugar pills, và cả phẫu thuật giả.
						- Vance Vanders bị ông thầy cúng dùng thuật voodoo để nguyền rủa cho chết đi, và ông ta đã bị suy nhược cơ thể đến sắp chết.
						- Khi vợ Vance Vanders đưa ổng vào bệnh viện tây y thì bác sỹ mới tìm cách dùng giả dược để "giải bùa" voodoo của ông thầy cúng kia. BS đã chích thuốc ói để cho ổng ói ra và lén thả con tắc kè xanh vào bồn ói rồi la toáng lên "Vance nhìn nè, ông đã ói con tắc kè đang ăn ruột ông ra rồi, ông đã được giải bùa rồi!" Vance nhìn con tắc kè mà sợ phát khiếp, rồi ngất đi trong 12h sau đó. Khi tỉnh dậy thì ông ta đã hết tâm bệnh và 1 tuần sau thì cơ thể ổng đã bình phục.

				- Còn bây giờ, dựa trên ý thức "ko làm là do mình, vì mình", thì em thấy nó khó quá ko có khả năng làm hả?
				- Lan:
				  dạ, khó, không làm dc
				  vì từng trải qua đau tới đó hoặc tương tự đó rồi nên không thể nào làm như vậy với ngta dc
				  nó như giết mình thêm lần nữa vậy
				- giả sử mình làm đi, em cứ để nó diễn ra đi (tưởng tượng, hoặc nhớ lại những lần "lỡ tay" trước), thì em cảm thấy thế nào?
				- Lan:
				  là đau
				  mất niềm tin vào những người mà mình tin nhất trong suốt bao nhiêu lâu
				  cảm thấy k sống nổi nữa, k muốn sống nữa
				- và bây giờ thì em cảm thấy như chồng đang mất niềm tin vào mình, mà em có xác nhận điều đó từ chồng ko, có chắc là chồng đau vì điều đó ko hay đau vì cái khác?
				- Lan:
				  ảnh chưa mất niềm tin vào em, ảnh chỉ mới cảm thấy sao dạo này em xa cách, ảnh cảm thấy sao ảnh đã thay đổi bớt ác với em rất nhiều, yêu thương em hơn, nhưng trách rằng em đang đòi tự do của em nhiều quá
				- Vậy đầu tiên là mình tự gợi lại nỗi đau của mình và nó khác với nỗi đau hiện tại của chồng hen.
				  Thực ra mình chả biết người ta đau cái gì đâu, mà chỉ có thể "suy bụng ta ra bụng người" thôi.
				- Perspectivistic: cùng lắm thì đó là những gì mình biết về người ta, ko thể nói hoành toàn chính xác là người ta như vậy.
				  Mỗi người là một thực thể đa chiều, rất phức tạp, chỉ thể hiện ra 1 mặt nào đó trong 1 hoàn cảnh cụ thể. Và "đi với phật mặc áo cà sa, đi với ma mặc áo giấy", sự "đồng thanh tương ứng" khiến họ thể hiện ra mặt này tương ứng với người đối diện, chứ đó ko phải là tất cả.
				- Perspectivism, em có chấp nhận được ko. Chấp nhận về ý thức thôi, chứ về cảm xúc thì chỉ khi tự mình nếm trải mới cảm được, anh ko đòi hỏi nó bây giờ. Chỉ hỏi là về mặt ý thức, thì em có thể "thấy" ra được là những gì mình biết về chồng chỉ là một phần của chồng ko?
				- Lan:
				  dạ có, chấp nhận
				- Vậy bây giờ để diễn ra tiếp, bây giờ là tưởng tượng nhé... xin lỗi là đưa ra một ví dụ tiêu cực, chỉ là giả dụ thôi, ko nói là chồng hiện tại của em sẽ như vậy nhé.... nào đã sẵn sàng cho một chuyến roller coaster chưa?
				- Lan:
				  ukie
				- Trong lúc đợi anh gõ, em nên buông ra để hít thở, đừng cắm mắt vào đợi, đừng suy nghĩ lan man, đc ko?

			- The dream
			  collapsed:: true
				- Hãy tưởng tượng một nhánh thời gian rẽ ra một cõi "trong mơ" để ko bị lẫn lộn với thực tế tương lai ở ngoài đời sau này.
				  Trong một cõi mơ, em có "tha tâm thông", là thần thông thấu biết tâm người, nên biết nỗi đau của chồng mình là gì, thấy nó có 3 phần giống của mình, tức phần "mất niềm tin", nhưng 7 phần còn lại là khác, VD "bị chê trách".
				- Ở đó, em bay lên từ trên cao nhìn xuống, thấy cái duyên mình gặp chồng đã khiến trong suốt quá trình đó ảnh chỉ thể hiện ra 3 phần và giấu lại 7 phần... mà con người phàm tục của mình "dưới kia" ko hề hay biết.
				- Rồi em lại có "thiên nhãn thông", là thần thông thấy biết xuyên không thời gian....
				- Với cái tâm tự do bay trên không, ko bị lớp áo da che mắt, em nhìn xuống xuyên qua không gian, thấy suốt ruột gan.... à mà thôi, toàn những thứ hôi thối xấu xa..., nên em quay đi, nhìn xuyên thời gian...
				- Nhìn xuyên thời gian, tới tương lai, em thấy con người trần tục "dưới kia" cứ cuốn vòng vòng với nỗi đau trong quá khứ về việc mất niềm tin của mình mà cố gắng tạo niềm tin...
				- vì cũng được thoả mãn 3 phần nên anh chồng vẫn có phần nhẹ bớt, nhưng chẳng bao giờ là hết hẳn, vì 7 phần còn lại lớn hơn gấp đôi lận...
				- và rồi một ngày nào đó... khi con người trần tục của em lẫn của chồng đều đã chịu hết nổi, bên em thì nhường nhịn hết nổi, bên chồng thì quá bất mãn vì ảnh cũng đã tưởng là gặp em sẽ giải quyết được 100% nỗi đau mà rốt cuộc lúc nào cũng còn đau 70-80%...
				- Thì đổ bể ra... ảnh lật 7 phần còn lại ra vì nó đã bị dồn nén quá lâu, nó thể hiện ra là một người rất khác với "người chồng" mà em đã từng quen thuộc, phủ nhận cả những điều hay ho nhứt, những lý tưởng cao đẹp mà ảnh đã share với em bấy lâu nay, và vô tình "phủi bỏ" hết công sức của em. 😢
				- Bị phủ nhận sạch trơn, con người trần tục của em lại một lần nữa mất hoàn toàn niềm tin, đau đớn khôn tả xiết!
				- Vì quá đau đớn, con người trần tục của em ko thể chấp nhận 7 phần còn lại của ảnh là thật, là cũng đau đớn ko kém mình, mà chỉ thấy là ảnh đã lừa dối mình bấy lâu.
				- Chìm đắm trong tuyệt vọng, đau khổ, em rút vào trong, chẳng thể mở lòng để có thể thấu hiểu được ai khác...
				- nhưng do con người trần tục đó ko có khả năng thấy rõ chính mình, nên theo bản năng thì nó cứ vô tình tìm tới một người "đồng cảnh ngộ" khác, dù cho ý thức vẫn cứ bảo "chỉ có mình mới giải quyết được thôi"
				- và cứ như thế mà nỗi đau cũ cứ cuốn mình vào vòng xoáy mới với ảo tưởng mới.... cứ hi vọng rồi sụp đổ, tin thật nhiều rồi nghi thật nhiều
				- Một ngày nào đó, cái thân người dưới kia chịu hết nổi, chết ngất, thoát xác, bay lên nhìn lại tất cả... thì mới ngộ là "ồ, nó là vậy đó!"
				- Xong giấc mơ, em có theo dõi kịp ko?
			- Closing

				- Khi "buồn ngủ mà gặp chiếu manh" thì chiếc chiếu dù rách nát vẫn còn hơn chăn nhung nệm gấm. Khi những tâm hồn đau khổ gặp nhau, dù chỉ 10% tương đồng là đã dữ lắm rồi, nên ban đầu luôn quay cái 10% đó vào nhau để thấy 100% là "đồng điệu", để hi vọng là mình đã gặp được duyên để giải quyết 100% đau khổ của mình.
				- Chỉ tới khi hết buồn ngủ, tỉnh dậy thì chiếc chiếu manh mới hiện nguyên hình...
				  *Thằng cùi mà lấy con đui
				  Đến khi sáng mắt, con đui bỏ chồng!*
				- Lan:
				  em nghĩ là nó k phải là tưởng tượng luôn vì nó đã xảy ra đúng như vậy đó anh. và đã xảy ra cách đây rất lâu rồi. do vậy em cũng không còn kì vọng rằng ảnh sẽ không bao giờ phủi bỏ mình. em đã chuẩn bị tư thế sẵn sàng để nếu ảnh có bỏ, thì cũng k là điều gì đáng ngạc nhiên
				- Thực ra tương lai chỉ là sự lặp lại của quá khứ... trong một vòng xoay vô tận. Nên nói là "tưởng tượng tương lai" thực ra chỉ là diễn lại quá khứ với một ngôn ngữ khác mà thôi.
				- Chỉ khi nào mình buông hết mọi thứ ra, để mình "bay lên", để nhìn xuống toàn bộ vòng tròn đó... mình mới thấy là... thực ra mình đã xoay vòng ko chỉ 1 mà nhiều nhiều vòng như vậy rồi... c
				- Vòng tròn vô tận đó chính là Luân Hồi, chứ chẳng cần phải chết đi mới được luân hồi 😃

						- (Phần thêm cuối) Cảnh sát yêu cầu dừng cuộc bộ hành
							- BBC Sinhala đã đặt câu hỏi với Phó Tổng Thanh tra Cảnh sát Buddhika Manathunga, người phát ngôn truyền thông cảnh sát, về tình hình liên quan đến chuyến thăm Sri Lanka của thầy Thích Minh Tuệ.
							- Người phát ngôn cho biết khoảng 40 người đã tham gia cuộc bộ hành này theo hình thức một đoàn diễu hành.
							  Ông giải thích rằng bộ hành được xem là một hoạt động thuộc loại diễu hành.
							- “Việc tổ chức diễu hành cần có giấy phép từ cảnh sát. Thứ hai, theo luật nhập cư, những người đến Sri Lanka bằng visa du lịch không được phép tham gia biểu tình.”
							- “Dựa trên tất cả những yếu tố này, chúng tôi đã thông báo với họ rằng hoạt động này là bất hợp pháp và cần được thực hiện sau khi có giấy phép. Vì vậy, họ đã dừng hoạt động này tại khu vực Kuliyapitiya. Hiện tại, họ đang lưu trú tại một ngôi chùa.”
							- Người phát ngôn cảnh sát nói thêm: “Nếu trong tương lai họ tiếp tục thực hiện hoạt động này mà không có giấy phép hợp lệ, đó sẽ là hành vi bất hợp pháp. Chúng tôi chắc chắn sẽ hành động theo luật hiện hành. Hiện tại, chưa có ai bị bắt giữ. Chúng tôi đang tiến hành điều tra để làm rõ các tình tiết.”
							- “Lần đầu tiên, chúng tôi đã thông báo yêu cầu họ dừng hoạt động này, và họ đã tuân thủ, dừng ngay tại thời điểm đó. Tuy nhiên, nếu họ tiếp tục thực hiện, chúng tôi chắc chắn sẽ áp dụng các biện pháp pháp lý.”
							- Người phát ngôn cho biết nhóm người Việt Nam này hiện đang lưu trú tại một tu viện rừng (aranya senasana) ở khu vực Warakapola.

						- Tóm tắt: Chuyến thăm Sri Lanka của thầy Thích Minh Tuệ, một nhân vật nổi tiếng nhưng cũng gây tranh cãi từ Việt Nam, đã vấp phải sự phản đối từ phái Malwatta và một số tu sĩ Phật giáo tại nước này. Vào ngày 10/4 vừa qua, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ cùng một nhóm người đi theo đã đến Sri Lanka và hiện đang thực hiện hành trình bộ hành qua nhiều khu vực trên đảo.
						  collapsed:: true
							- Các video được đăng trên mạng xã hội của thầy Thích Minh Tuệ cho thấy nhóm này được các tu sĩ Phật giáo và Phật tử tại nhiều ngôi chùa ở Sri Lanka tiếp đón.
							- thầy Thích Minh Tuệ gây tranh cãi vì bị Giáo hội Phật giáo Việt Nam, tổ chức Phật giáo duy nhất được chính phủ Việt Nam công nhận, bác bỏ tư cách tu sĩ. Giáo hội này đã gắn nhãn thầy Thích Minh Tuệ là “tu sĩ giả”.
							- Theo điều tra của BBC Sinhala, Giáo hội Phật giáo Việt Nam đã gửi thư đến Bộ Phật giáo và Tôn giáo Sri Lanka, yêu cầu không công nhận thầy Thích Minh Tuệ tại nước này.
							- Trong một cuộc trao đổi với BBC Sinhala, ông W.P. Senadheera, thư ký Bộ Phật giáo và Tôn giáo, xác nhận đã được thông báo về một lá thư như vậy.
							- Lá thư này cũng cho biết nhóm của thầy Thích Minh Tuệ đến Sri Lanka không phải là một phái đoàn ngoại giao, theo thông tin được cung cấp cho ông Senadheera.

							  Chú thích: Ảnh chụp màn hình video ghi lại cảnh các nhà sư và Phật tử chào đón đoàn bộ hành Việt Nam tại nhiều ngôi chùa trên khắp hòn đảo cũng đã được đăng trên mạng xã hội của đoàn bộ hành.
							- Tổng Ủy viên Ban Phật giáo R.M.P. Ratnayake nói với BBC Sinhala rằng nhóm này đã đến Sri Lanka bằng visa du lịch. Ông nói: “Họ có thể đến như vậy, họ có hộ chiếu và đã được cấp visa.”
							- Tuy nhiên, Thượng toạ Pelane Dhamma Kusala, trụ trì chùa ở Berlin, Đức, cho biết ông đã cảnh báo chính quyền Sri Lanka về nhóm này trước khi họ đến, nhưng không có hành động kịp thời nào được thực hiện.
							- Ông nói: “Họ đã đến đây rồi, ngay ngày họ đến tôi đã báo cho Ủy viên Phật giáo, rằng đất nước chúng ta không có quy định như vậy. Nhưng họ chẳng làm gì cả. Bất cứ ai cũng có thể đến đây và làm bất cứ điều gì.”
							- “Nhóm này đang diễn kịch. Họ đi ngược lại Giáo hội Phật giáo ở Việt Nam, thể hiện quan điểm đối lập và khiến người ta cảm thấy họ như những vị Phật. Có cả một nhóm cư sĩ đi cùng họ. Họ dùng YouTube để tuyên truyền, ở nhiều nơi trên thế giới có người Việt Nam sinh sống. Họ quyên góp tiền từ những người này. Đó là một tổ chức lớn.”
							- “Nhóm đó thực hiện việc đi bộ. Họ đến các ngôi chùa và cho thế giới thấy người dân Sri Lanka kính trọng họ. Sri Lanka là một quốc gia Phật giáo, và họ muốn thể hiện rằng đất nước Phật giáo này công nhận họ. Điều này khiến chính phủ Việt Nam và các tu sĩ ở đó khó chịu, vì những người bị họ bác bỏ lại được chúng ta công nhận.” Thượng tọa Pelane Dhamma Kusala Thero đã nói với BBC Sinhala như thế.

						- ඒ වගේ ම මම හැමෝට ම කියනවා මම ගුරුවරයෙක්, භික්ෂුවක් හෝ කිසි ම ආකාරයක පල්ලියකට හෝ සංඝ සභාවකට අයත් නොවන බව. මම සාමාන්‍ය මනුස්සයෙක්. අතීතයේදී මම බුදුන් වහන්සේගේ ධර්මය ඉගෙන ගෙන ඒ අනුව කටයුතු කළා.
						- මම දකින වෙනස තමයි ඉස්සර මට ගොඩක් දේවල් අරගෙන යන්න වුණා. ඒත් දැන් මේ තුන්පට සිවුරයි, පාත්තරයයි ඇරෙන්න මට වෙන දෙයක් නැහැ.

						  Chú thích: Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ nghỉ ngơi tại một công viên gần đường số 217 ở tỉnh Ubon Ratchathani
						- Ngày đăng: 13/01/2025
						- Cuộc bộ hành của thầy Thích Minh Tuệ, người đang đi bộ khất thực đến vùng đất nơi Đức Phật đản sinh, đang thu hút sự chú ý của nhiều người. Trong lúc thầy cùng đoàn chư tăng đi bộ qua vùng đông bắc Thái Lan, BBC News Việt Nam đã có cơ hội trò chuyện với thầy.
						- Trước đây, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ từng gây chú ý khi thực hiện cuộc bộ hành khắp Việt Nam, làm xôn xao dư luận. Thay vì dùng bát truyền thống, thầy mang theo một **nồi cơm điện**, điều này không chỉ gây tò mò mà còn khiến nhiều người ngưỡng mộ.
						- Lý do thầy trở thành chủ đề nổi bật trong cộng đồng Phật tử gần như không cần giải thích. Sự kiên định với **13 hạnh đầu đà**, cùng lối sống tu hành đặc biệt, đã biến hành động của thầy thành một hiện tượng độc đáo. Điều này bao gồm việc đi bộ chân trần, sống bằng khất thực, tìm nơi trú ẩn trong rừng sâu, nghĩa trang, hoặc dưới bóng cây, và từ bỏ mọi luyến ái với vật chất.
						- Cuộc đối thoại giữa chúng tôi và thầy Thích Minh Tuệ diễn ra tại một công viên gần đường cao tốc 217 ở tỉnh Ubon Ratchathani, Thái Lan, khi thầy dừng chân để nhận bữa trưa.
						- Trong buổi phỏng vấn, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ đã chia sẻ quan điểm về lối sống tu hành, cảm xúc, và trải nghiệm từ nhiều năm bộ hành.
						- **BBC**: Thưa thầy, việc bộ hành ở Lào và Thái Lan giống và khác với bộ hành ở Việt Nam như thế nào?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**:
							- Khí hậu ở Lào và Thái Lan khác với Việt Nam, có phần lạnh hơn. Đường sá, rừng rậm, và nhiều thứ khác cũng khác. Con người và phong tục cũng không giống nhau.
							- Một điểm khác nữa là ở Lào và Thái Lan, tôi gặp ít Phật tử hơn so với khi bộ hành ở Việt Nam. Ở Việt Nam, đặc biệt tại Quảng Trị và Huế, đông người theo dõi, gây ra tắc nghẽn giao thông. Ở đây [Lào và Thái Lan], không có tình trạng kẹt xe, mọi thứ đều tốt và ổn định.
							- Dù đường sá khó khăn hay mệt mỏi, ở đâu cũng vậy, bộ hành đòi hỏi sự kiên trì không ngừng.
							- Chuyện ăn uống thì ở đâu cũng giống nhau. Có lúc đói, nhưng vẫn phải giữ giới. Mỗi ngày chỉ nhận một bữa ăn. Dù đi bên trái hay bên phải con đường nhựa, cũng không có gì khác biệt.

						- **BBC**: Trên đường, xe cộ lớn chạy nhanh qua lại. Khi bộ hành như vậy, thầy có cảm thấy lo lắng về an toàn không?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Không. Chúng tôi đi bộ ở lề đường, tuân theo luật lệ.
							- Không thể lo lắng về sự sống và cái chết.
							- Tôi không bận tâm đến sức khỏe hay cái chết. Nếu tôi chết, cũng không có vấn đề gì. Vì có xe cộ, tôi đi bên phải đường.
							- Nếu tôi sợ hãi khi họ lái xe qua, tôi sẽ không tiếp tục cuộc hành trình này nữa, tôi sẽ dừng lại.
						- **BBC**: Thầy có thể chia sẻ sự khác biệt giữa việc bộ hành một mình và bộ hành cùng các vị sư khác không?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Có, có sự khác biệt.
							- Ví dụ, bộ hành một mình dễ dàng và tự do hơn. Nhưng khi đi cùng một nhóm, nhiều thứ thay đổi, như phải tìm nơi nghỉ ngơi đủ rộng cho cả đoàn.
							- Khi đi một mình, tôi có thể dừng ở bất cứ đâu, rất tự do. Nhưng giờ đây, khi đi cùng người khác, có người giúp tôi, báo trước các việc cần làm.
							- Ví dụ, có anh Bảo, anh Sếp, và hôm nay có anh Sơn đi cùng. Họ thông báo cho tôi về nơi nghỉ, liên lạc với chính quyền. Họ báo trước khi đến mỗi nơi. Tôi cảm thấy mọi thứ diễn ra tốt đẹp và điều đó mang lại niềm vui.
							- Dù đi một mình hay cùng người khác, điều quan trọng là tâm trí. Tôi ngồi đây với các vị sư, gặp gỡ mọi người, nhưng tâm tôi vẫn tĩnh lặng. Dù không có ai, tôi vẫn cảm thấy như vậy.
							- Tâm trí không ngừng hoạt động giống như một nơi đông đúc. Dù bạn ngồi một chỗ hay đi bộ một mình, bạn luôn nghĩ về người khác.
							- Nếu không, bạn sẽ sinh lòng tham ái với người này, hoặc sân hận với người kia, hoặc những suy nghĩ tiêu cực và dục vọng thế tục. Khi tâm khởi những điều đó, chẳng khác gì ở giữa đám đông.
							- Khi tôi ở đây, nếu tôi không sân hận hay bực tức vì sự hiện diện của người khác, tôi xem mình như đang ở một mình. Đó chính là sự khác biệt.
							- Nói chung, việc một nơi đông đúc hay không phụ thuộc vào tâm trí bạn. Bạn có thể ở giữa khu chợ đông người, nhưng nếu không tương tác với họ, nơi đó như không có ai. Bạn ở một mình. Nhưng nếu tâm bạn rối loạn hay bị phân tán, thì nơi đó trở nên đông đúc.

						- **BBC**: Theo lối sống tu hành của thầy, một ngày diễn ra như thế nào?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Ban đêm, chúng tôi nghỉ ngơi.
							- Thông thường, chúng tôi đi bộ từ 6 giờ sáng đến 7 giờ tối. Nếu chưa hoàn thành chặng đường, chúng tôi đi thêm một chút rồi nghỉ.
							- Khi mặt trời mọc, hoặc khi đường không còn ồn ào, chúng tôi đi khất thực. Thường thì những việc này không có giờ cố định.
							- Điều quan trọng là ở đúng nơi vào đúng thời điểm. Ví dụ, khi đến một nơi, nếu mọi người nói họ mệt hoặc đã quá trưa, chúng tôi nghỉ. Tôi không nói mình chỉ đi một quãng ngắn mà nghỉ, nhưng tôi nghỉ khi cần. Giờ tôi phải tiếp tục đi xa hơn.
							- Nói chung, dù là làm việc, nghỉ ngơi, hay ăn uống, quan trọng là ở đúng nơi vào đúng lúc.
							- Có lúc đi bộ mệt, tôi ngủ sớm và dậy sớm. Không phải lúc nào cũng ngủ lúc 10 giờ và dậy lúc 2 giờ. Đôi khi sớm hoặc muộn hơn 5-10 phút, gần đúng là được. Không cần tuân theo lịch trình nghiêm ngặt.
							- Nói chung, mọi thứ phụ thuộc vào duyên.
							- Việc đi trên đường và nghỉ ngơi cũng tương đối. Điều quan trọng là nghỉ đúng lúc trong hành trình. Không có luật bắt phải đi vào buổi trưa, mọi thứ tùy thuộc vào hoàn cảnh. Nhưng cũng không có luật bắt phải đi mỗi ngày.
						- **BBC**: Trong lúc bộ hành, thầy suy nghĩ hay thiền quán về điều gì?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Khi đi bộ, tôi suy nghĩ.
							- Tôi mong rằng nếu tôi và người khác muốn đi bộ, chúng tôi có thể đi. Tôi mong mọi người hạnh phúc, khỏe mạnh, và đạt được điều họ cần. Khi bộ hành, tôi mong cầu hòa bình và niềm vui.
							- Tôi mong mọi người có thể đến các nước khác mà không gặp trở ngại. Chúng tôi có thể sống hạnh phúc, tự do, thoải mái, không làm hại đất nước đó.
							- Nói chung, tôi có giới hạnh, đạo đức, và trí tuệ để không làm hại ai. Tôi không hành động gây hại. Tôi không có tham vọng kinh tế, chính trị, hay chiến tranh. Tôi bộ hành để tìm sự an lạc và hòa bình.
							- Tôi mong đi lại mà không gây hại hay nguy hiểm cho ai. Tôi tin rằng mọi người đều có thể làm được điều đó, đi lại thoải mái mà không gặp trở ngại.
							- Như một con nai trong rừng, có thể đi lại, nằm nghỉ, hay ngồi tùy ý. Không bị giam cầm, không lo âu, không bị trộm cắp, không có hành vi sai trái. Đó là điều tôi mong đợi.
						- **BBC**: Trong thời gian sống theo lối tu hành này, có câu chuyện nào khiến thầy xúc động hoặc bài học quý giá nào thầy muốn chia sẻ không?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Có,
							- đây không phải suy tư sâu sắc hay gì đặc biệt, nhưng tôi thấy, ví dụ, anh Bảo và anh Lâm giờ có thể giữ năm giới, không sát sinh, không trộm cắp, không tà dâm, không nói dối, không uống rượu, luôn yêu thương mọi người, và sống mà không gây phiền hà cho người khác như trước đây.
							- Tôi vui vì sự thay đổi đó. Nếu mọi người cũng làm được như vậy, tôi thấy đó là điều tốt đẹp.
						- **BBC**: Sau thời gian sống theo lối tu hành này, thầy thấy mình thay đổi thế nào?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Tôi thấy mình thay đổi, khác so với lối sống thế tục.
							- Tôi cũng nói với mọi người rằng tôi không phải thầy, không phải tăng sĩ, cũng không thuộc giáo hội hay tổ chức nào. Tôi là một người bình thường. Trước đây, tôi học giáo pháp của Đức Phật và thực hành theo đó.
							- Sự thay đổi tôi thấy là trước đây tôi phải mang theo nhiều thứ. Nhưng giờ, ngoài ba y và bình bát, tôi không có gì khác.

						- **BBC**: Nhìn lại vài năm trước, tại sao thầy quyết định theo lối tu hành này?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Khi đọc giáo pháp, tôi thấy không ai vĩ đại như Đức Phật. Ngài dạy những điều tốt đẹp nhất. Nếu có ai giỏi hơn, tôi sẽ theo người đó. Nhưng tôi chưa gặp ai như vậy. Vì thế, tôi quyết định học những điều tốt đẹp, đi theo con đường Đức Phật chỉ dạy, và sống hạnh phúc theo lời Ngài. Tôi hướng đến hạnh phúc, giải thoát, và trí tuệ.
						- **BBC**: Khi quyết định xuất gia, thầy có thông báo với gia đình không? Họ phản ứng thế nào?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Trước khi xuất gia, tôi thực hành giáo pháp của Đức Phật trong sáu tháng. Sau đó, tôi xin phép gia đình. Tôi chỉ xuất gia nếu cha mẹ đồng ý. Họ đã đồng ý.
							- Giờ tôi là một tăng sĩ, tôi không còn xem họ là cha mẹ theo cách cũ. Tôi muốn học sự bình đẳng. Mọi người đều là cha mẹ tôi.
							- Dù các bạn ngồi đây, tôi xem các bạn như anh em, họ hàng. Tôi không còn khái niệm về cha mẹ hay không cha mẹ. Tôi cầu mong mọi người hạnh phúc, an lạc. Tôi là một người học giáo pháp của Đức Phật.
						- **BBC**: Ban đêm ở Thái Lan khá lạnh. Thầy làm thế nào để chịu đựng cái lạnh vào ban đêm?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Ban đêm, tôi tìm nơi kín gió để nghỉ. Với y áo cũng vậy. Tôi lấy ba y, xếp lại, khâu thành lớp dày để giữ ấm, tự làm áo bảo vệ mình. Sống với ba y và một bình bát, bạn phải rèn luyện sự chịu đựng.
							- Có lúc tôi nghĩ mình không chịu nổi, nên tôi dùng tấm vải lều để chắn gió. Nói chung, nếu bạn chưa được rèn luyện đủ, thiếu quyết tâm, hoặc không chịu nổi, bạn có thể tập dần dần để thích nghi. Đó là mong muốn, nhưng không ai nói tôi phải chịu được lạnh. Mọi thứ đến từ rèn luyện. Rèn luyện chắc chắn sẽ giúp bạn vượt qua.

						  Chú thích: Cuộc bộ hành của thầy Thích Minh Tuệ đã truyền cảm hứng tích cực cho hàng triệu người
						- **BBC**: Trong một bài viết, thầy nói muốn đi bộ đến Ấn Độ, chỉ cần một người hỗ trợ thủ tục giấy tờ, và thầy có thể tự mình đi. Giờ có các vị sư khác, cùng anh Đỗ Văn Bảo, anh Lê Khả Sếp hỗ trợ, và có xe chở đồ. Sự hỗ trợ này có ảnh hưởng đến tinh thần ban đầu và sự thuần khiết của lối tu hành của thầy không?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Có và không. Những chiếc xe đó hỗ trợ cho những người đi cùng.
							- Tôi không cần mang gì. Tôi có thể tự mang đồ của mình, thức ăn, y áo. Xe là để hỗ trợ những người đi cùng tôi.
							- Vì họ cần giữ ấm, cần giường treo, chăn đệm. Họ có xe. Nếu không đi bộ được, họ dùng xe để làm giấy tờ, liên lạc với chính quyền địa phương. Việc hỗ trợ đó là điều tốt.
							- Theo tôi, trở ngại là khi người ngoài thấy xe và nói: “Anh đi bộ, nhưng có đoàn xe chở đồ theo sau.”
							- Đó là điều người ta nói. Với cách học của tôi, điều đó không thành vấn đề cho đến khi tôi cảm thấy nó không đúng. Tôi vẫn mặc ba y. Dù họ nói gì về xe, mọi thứ vẫn vậy.

						- **BBC**: Giáo lý Phật giáo nào thầy yêu thích nhất và muốn chia sẻ với mọi người?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Theo giáo lý Phật giáo, làm điều thiện là quan trọng nhất. Sau đó là hạnh phúc, hòa bình, giải thoát, và Niết bàn, những điều quan trọng nhất. Tôi cầu mong mọi người sống hạnh phúc, hưởng hòa bình. Giải thoát nghĩa là họ sống hạnh phúc hơn nữa.
						- **BBC**: Trong lúc bộ hành, thầy có nhớ gia đình không, đặc biệt khi ở nước ngoài?
						- **Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ**: Có nhớ, nhưng cũng không nhớ. Tôi có nhớ, nhưng tôi chế ngự điều đó.
							- Cha mẹ tôi sớm muộn cũng qua đời. Tôi cũng vậy. Nhớ họ không thay đổi được gì. Đau khổ, tình yêu là nguồn gốc của đau khổ, là nguồn gốc của sợ hãi. Khi hiểu được điều này, tôi không còn cảm giác về tình yêu nữa.
							- Tình yêu là tạm thời. Tôi chế ngự nó. Nếu bạn có thể giải thoát khỏi mọi thứ, bạn sẽ không còn đau khổ.
							- Biết vậy mà tôi vẫn đau khổ, tôi chấp nhận, rồi học giáo pháp của Đức Phật. Từ đó, tôi vượt qua tham ái, buồn đau, và cuối cùng thoát khỏi khổ đau.

						- Vào một buổi sáng tháng Sáu tràn đầy sự tĩnh lặng, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ lặng lẽ đi khất thực ở Gia Lai, một vùng cao nguyên miền Trung Việt Nam đầy khó khăn. Đó là nơi thầy chọn để ẩn mình sau cuộc bộ hành gây xôn xao cả nước, thu hút sự chú ý của nhiều người. Thay vì dùng bát khất thực truyền thống, thầy mang theo một **nồi cơm điện**, điều này không chỉ gây tò mò mà còn khiến nhiều người ngưỡng mộ.
						- Lý do thầy trở thành tâm điểm chú ý trong cộng đồng Phật tử gần như không cần giải thích. Sự kiên định với **13 hạnh đầu đà**, cùng lối sống tu hành đặc biệt, đã biến hành động của thầy thành một hiện tượng độc đáo. Điều này bao gồm việc đi bộ chân trần, sống bằng khất thực, tìm nơi trú ẩn trong rừng sâu, nghĩa trang, hoặc dưới bóng cây, và từ bỏ mọi luyến ái với vật chất.
						- (Image 2: Thich Minh Tue)
						  Chú thích: Có bằng chứng cho thấy thầy và các đệ tử buộc phải từ bỏ cuộc bộ hành do áp lực từ chính quyền
						- Tuy nhiên, thầy không thể tiếp tục thực hành lối sống tu hành của mình một cách bình thường, bởi hàng trăm người hâm mộ và đệ tử mới đã tìm đến thầy ở mỗi bước chân, mang theo thức ăn, chỗ nghỉ, và thậm chí quỳ lạy để bày tỏ sự tôn kính.
						- Cuộc bộ hành của thầy Thích Minh Tuệ kết thúc vào ngày 3 tháng 6, sau khi một đệ tử ([LTS, việt kiều Mỹ](https://vnexpress.net/mot-nguoi-di-theo-ong-thich-minh-tue-bi-soc-nhiet-tu-vong-4752943.html)) qua đời do sốc nhiệt trong thời tiết nóng bức tháng Năm. Chính quyền cho biết thầy tự nguyện dừng cuộc bộ hành và quyết định ẩn tu tại một địa điểm bí mật gần nhà ở Gia Lai để thực hành các nghi thức tôn giáo. Tuy nhiên, có bằng chứng cho thấy thầy và các đệ tử buộc phải từ bỏ cuộc bộ hành do áp lực từ chính quyền.

						- ## Hiện tượng độc đáo
						  collapsed:: true
							- Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ, 43 tuổi, đã thu hút một lượng lớn người theo trong cuộc bộ hành khắp đất nước. Thầy bắt đầu hành trình lặng lẽ từ năm 2017, như một chuyến đi cá nhân, chỉ ăn một bữa trước trưa mỗi ngày. Thầy đã trải qua hàng nghìn đêm ngủ trong nghĩa trang hoặc bất cứ nơi nào trong rừng.
							- Vào tháng 5 năm 2024, hành động của thầy thu hút sự chú ý rộng rãi trên Facebook, TikTok, và YouTube, khiến nhiều người có cùng chí hướng từ khắp nơi trên cả nước tìm đến tham gia cùng thầy. Từ đó, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ trở thành một nhân vật nổi tiếng trên truyền thông, và đối với nhiều người dùng YouTube, thầy trở thành nguồn thu nhập.

							  Chú thích: Hành động của thầy thu hút sự chú ý rộng rãi trên Facebook, TikTok, và YouTube
							- “Hiện tượng độc đáo liên quan đến thầy Thích Minh Tuệ” diễn ra trong bối cảnh Phật giáo Việt Nam đã biến đổi, xa rời các giá trị truyền thống. Trước khi cuộc bộ hành dừng lại, các nhóm người hành hương đầy nhiệt huyết và tận tụy đã đến để gặp, chạm vào thầy, hoặc cúng dường qua mạng xã hội, gây ra ùn tắc giao thông nghiêm trọng ở các thành phố lớn như Quảng Trị và Huế.
							- Những chuyến đi của thầy đã khơi mào các cuộc tranh luận công khai về các yếu tố cốt lõi của Phật giáo, tôn giáo chính tại Việt Nam. Hình ảnh của thầy đã góp phần vào việc chỉ trích các vị sư tham nhũng, thiếu gương mẫu, lợi dụng giáo pháp để trục lợi tài chính. Hàng loạt chùa chiền lớn được xây dựng nhờ sự tài trợ của các doanh nhân giàu có, biến một tôn giáo thành ngành công nghiệp trị giá hàng tỷ đô la, đặc biệt khi các khoản quyên góp cho các tổ chức tôn giáo được miễn thuế và không bị kiểm toán.
							- Đảng Cộng sản Việt Nam, theo chủ nghĩa vô thần, sử dụng Phật giáo để thu phục lòng dân trong một quốc gia coi tôn giáo là một phần truyền thống. Nhiều lãnh đạo cấp cao thường xuất hiện bên các vị sư cao cấp để bày tỏ sự ủng hộ.
							- (Image 5: Thich Minh Tue and other monks walking on the road)
							- Trong bối cảnh Phật giáo bị lợi dụng vì lợi ích chính trị hoặc tài chính, tham nhũng trong các tổ chức tôn giáo trở nên phổ biến. Đầu năm nay, chính quyền đã kỷ luật trụ trì chùa Bà Vàng ở miền Bắc Việt Nam vì tổ chức triển lãm “Xá lợi tóc Đức Phật” nhằm mục đích tài chính.
							- “Phong cách sống giản dị của thầy hoàn toàn khác biệt so với các vị sư ở những ngôi chùa lớn với tượng đài hoành tráng, những người nói một đằng làm một nẻo,” Thạc sĩ Bửu Nghiêm, chuyên gia về Phật giáo ứng dụng tại [Viện Nan Tien](https://www.nantien.edu.au/), Australia, chia sẻ với BBC.
							- Nhà sử học [Pascal Bourdeaux](https://www.ephe.psl.eu/pascal-bourdeaux), nổi tiếng với nghiên cứu về tôn giáo ở Việt Nam và Đông Nam Á tại École Pratique des Hautes Études, cho rằng thầy Thích Minh Tuệ là một nhân vật được kính trọng rộng rãi. Thầy có thể được xem như một phản ứng chống lại sự bất tín trong chính trị quốc gia và quốc tế, hoặc bất mãn xã hội, thông qua những ý định tâm linh và mong cầu giải thoát.

							  Chú thích: Những chuyến đi của thầy đã khơi mào các cuộc tranh luận công khai về các yếu tố cốt lõi của Phật giáo, tôn giáo chính tại Việt Nam
							- Ở Việt Nam, có vị thiền sư nổi tiếng quốc tế hơn cả trong nước đó là là [Thích Nhất Hạnh](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Nh%E1%BA%A5t_H%E1%BA%A1nh). Dù chưa đạt được sự chú ý toàn cầu như vậy, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ đã trở thành một chất xúc tác trong nước. Sự khác biệt cơ bản giữa hai vị sư rất rõ ràng: Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ không phải là một nhà thuyết pháp. Thay vào đó, thầy truyền cảm hứng qua hành động và những lời nói giản dị, khiêm tốn, chân thành. Trong một video, với khuôn mặt sưng tấy, máu chảy ở khóe miệng, thầy từ bi kể về việc bị tấn công khi đi khất thực:
							- “Khi bị đánh và thoát khỏi sự giận dữ, con cảm thấy thương xót cho những người đánh con. Con rất hoan hỉ và cầu mong họ được an lành.”
							- Bộ y áo của thầy, được may từ những mảnh vải vụn nhặt được trong các chuyến đi, kể cả ở nghĩa trang, đã truyền cảm hứng cho nhiều tác phẩm nghệ thuật, từ tranh vẽ, tượng, thơ ca đến thời trang.
							- Một đệ tử của thầy Thích Minh Tuệ nói với BBC: “Hiện tượng độc đáo liên quan đến thầy Thích Minh Tuệ là lời mời gọi rõ ràng để mọi người tự phản tỉnh. Những người từ các tầng lớp xã hội khác nhau không thể tránh khỏi việc thay đổi suy nghĩ và nhận thức.”
							- Hòa thượng Thích Sảo Quang, trụ trì một ngôi chùa ở Louisiana, Mỹ, tin rằng hiện tượng thầy Thích Minh Tuệ mang lại hy vọng. Hình ảnh giản dị và chân thành của thầy được xem như một sự đối trọng với chủ nghĩa vật chất thái quá hiện nay. Hơn nữa, câu chuyện của thầy là thông điệp dành cho các vị sư, khuyến khích ưu tiên việc giảng dạy và phát triển tâm linh hơn nhu cầu vật chất, đồng thời ảnh hưởng đến Phật giáo ngoài Việt Nam.
							- Pascal Bourdeaux so sánh hiện tượng này với Khất Sĩ, một tông phái Phật giáo lớn ở miền Nam Việt Nam, được [Minh Đăng Quang](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minh_%C4%90%C4%83ng_Quang) thành lập vào những năm 1940, cũng thực hành đi bộ và khất thực tương tự. Ông nói: “Một cách giải thích rõ ràng là người Việt Nam ngày càng quan tâm đến Phật giáo. Họ nỗ lực hiểu rõ hơn các giá trị cốt lõi của giáo pháp và triết lý Ấn Độ, hơn là các truyền thống Phật giáo Trung Quốc.”
							- Minh Đăng Quang được kính trọng rộng rãi ở miền Nam Việt Nam trước khi biến mất bí ẩn trong một chuyến bộ hành vào năm 1954, không để lại bất kỳ thông tin nào.

							- Pascal Bourdeaux cho biết một số người xem thầy Thích Minh Tuệ như một vị thầy tâm linh hoàn toàn tận tụy vì xã hội, trong khi những người khác coi thầy là một vị sư giả mạo, lợi dụng truyền thông để thao túng dư luận: “Chẳng có gì mới. Nhưng chính mạng xã hội đã tạo ra hiện tượng này.”
							- Việc trở nên nổi tiếng qua mạng xã hội mang lại cả kết quả tích cực lẫn tiêu cực. Đặc biệt ở Việt Nam, khi một người nhận được sự chú ý lớn như vậy, các vấn đề thường theo sau. Ủy ban Tự do Tôn giáo Quốc tế Hoa Kỳ (USCIRF) liệt Việt Nam vào danh sách các quốc gia đàn áp tôn giáo nghiêm trọng.
							- Khi “hiện tượng Thích Minh Tuệ” trở thành đề tài bàn tán, Giáo hội Phật giáo Việt Nam (VBS), tổ chức Phật giáo duy nhất được chính phủ công nhận, tuyên bố không công nhận thầy Thích Minh Tuệ là một vị sư. Hơn nữa, truyền thông nhà nước gọi thầy bằng tên thật thay vì pháp danh, cho thấy chính phủ Việt Nam cũng không công nhận thầy.
							- (Image 8: Thich Minh Tue)
							  Chú thích: Truyền thông nhà nước gọi thầy bằng tên thật thay vì pháp danh, cho thấy chính phủ Việt Nam không công nhận thầy
							- Thực tế, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ không tuyên bố mình là một vị sư hay thuộc bất kỳ chùa chiền, tổ chức nào dưới sự quản lý của Giáo hội Phật giáo Việt Nam. Thay vào đó, thầy tự xem mình là một người nỗ lực thực hành theo lời dạy của Đức Phật. Sự tận tụy để sống như một vị sư độc lập, cùng với sự ủng hộ ngày càng tăng xung quanh thầy, có thể là lý do chính dẫn đến sự biến mất của thầy.
							- Khi thầy Thích Minh Tuệ đột ngột biến mất vào sáng sớm ngày 3 tháng 6, nhiều người nhớ đến câu chuyện của Minh Đăng Quang, người cũng biến mất cách đây 70 năm trong lúc bộ hành chân trần.
							- Để đáp lại sự nghi ngờ của công chúng, vào ngày 8 tháng 6, Đài Truyền hình Việt Nam (VTV), do nhà nước quản lý, phát sóng một video dài 3 phút với tiêu đề “Thông tin sai lệch về thực hành của Thích Minh Tuệ” nhằm chống lại tin đồn và quảng bá chính sách của Đảng Cộng sản. Trong video, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ nói rằng thể chất và tinh thần của mình vẫn tốt, và thầy tiếp tục thực hành theo lời dạy của Đức Phật. Thầy cho biết khi không có đám đông gây rối loạn trật tự xã hội, thầy có thể tập trung vào việc tu học như thường lệ.
							- Video của truyền thông nhà nước không làm dịu nỗi lo lắng của công chúng. Hai ngày sau, cảnh sát công bố một video cho thấy thầy nhận thẻ căn cước mới và nói rằng thầy đã dừng cuộc bộ hành do lo ngại về an ninh từ việc đám đông tụ tập.
							- Tuy nhiên, hai video này, được sử dụng như một phần của chiến dịch tuyên truyền nhà nước, lại thu hút đám đông lớn hơn đến nơi thầy ẩn tu ở Gia Lai.
							- (Image 9: Thich Minh Tue and other monks walking on the road)
							- “Hiện tượng Thích Minh Tuệ khiến chính quyền bối rối. Có lẽ họ vẫn chưa thống nhất cách xử lý tình huống này. Nhờ sự hiểu biết sâu sắc về giáo pháp, ngay cả trong chính quyền cũng có nhiều người ủng hộ thầy Thích Minh Tuệ,” Bửu Nghiêm nói.
							- Sau sự xuất hiện trên truyền hình và những tin đồn tiếp theo, thầy Thích Minh Tuệ chuyển đến một khu vườn của gia đình ở Gia Lai để sống ẩn dật. Địa điểm mới này của thầy vẫn tiếp tục thu hút sự chú ý. Đám đông đầy tò mò và sùng kính vẫn tụ tập quanh khu vực thầy thực hành giáo pháp ở quê nhà, dẫn đến việc cảnh sát phải dựng rào chắn giao thông.
							- Vào ngày 13 tháng 6, em trai của thầy Thích Minh Tuệ (anh Thìn) xuất hiện trong một video trên TikTok, nói rằng thầy không còn ở khu vườn của gia đình. Trong khi đó, sáng ngày 14 tháng 6, mạng xã hội đưa tin rằng vị sư này “đã biến mất”.
							- “Thầy Thích Minh Tuệ cần được tự do sống đời sống xuất gia của mình. Theo tôi, thầy tận tụy sống theo giới luật. Việc giới hạn đời sống xuất gia của thầy trong một khu vực nhỏ làm lu mờ ý nghĩa thực sự của đời sống tu hành theo Phật giáo. Vì vậy, đây là một vấn đề khó giải quyết đối với chính quyền,” Bửu Nghiêm nói.

				- [April 18](https://economynext.com/vietnams-famed-walking-ascetic-minh-tue-in-sri-lanka-amid-obstacles-216441/): Vietnam’s famed walking ascetic Minh Tuệ in Sri Lanka amid obstacles
					- Friday April 18, 2025 2:37 pm
					- A Vietnam ascetic, who has gained widespread acclaim from the ordinary public in his country for his simple lifestyle, is facing obstacles as he is walking across Sri Lanka to reach the Buddha’s birthplace in India.
					  collapsed:: true
						- Known popularly by the sobriquet Thích Minh Tuệ, the ascetic reportedly walked across Vietnam at least four times, over several years before some youtubers and ticktockers noticed in 2024 and started following him around bringing him to national and international attention.
						- The ascetic, who’s birth [name is said to be Lê Anh Tú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Minh_Tu%E1%BB%87), walks barefoot, and is dressed in robes made of scraps of different cloth given to him by people on his travels. His alms bowl is the inner container of a rice cooker.
						- The ascetic has run into controversy with an officially sanctioned Buddhist order in Vietnam after netizens started comparing his simple lifestyle with those in the establishment.
						- According to reports Minh Tuệ has not claimed to be an official monk, but only a student of Buddhist teachings and is following dhutanga practices ([asceticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asceticism))
						- Though others refer to him as ‘Thích’ (Venerable) he always refers to himself simply as ‘con’ in the way students refer to themselves when addressing teachers, reports say.
						- Vietnam regional authorities also reportedly urged Minh Tuệ to stop walking last year as large crowds followed when he entered larger townships bringing city traffic to a standstill.
						- For a while he disappeared off the main roads, leading to speculation and concern among his internet followers. In December 2024, Minh Tuệ had started a pilgrimage to India to reach the birthplace of the Buddha, walking across several countries including Laos and Thailand.
						- He was originally planning to go to India across Myanmar but could not secure entry and had instead traveled to Malaysia and ended up in Sri Lanka.
						- After landing in Sri Lanka he had started walking across the island towards Jaffna. Youtube videos show he arrived in Sri Lanka from Singapore.
					- According to a senior monk from the Ambarukkarama Temple of Mugurugampala in Sri Lanka who is helping the ascetic, the group is facing difficulties after another senior Sri Lankan monk asked temples not to harbhour him.
					  collapsed:: true
						- The group of over 30 ascetics and Vietnamese lay followers had landed in Sri Lanka on April 12 and also stayed at his own Temple on the New Year’s day.
						- “From our observations these people are very harmless, responsible and act with much discipline (vinyawath),” the thero explained.
						- “They are engaged in a Dhutangadari practices and are walking barefoot.
						- “We thought we should treat these visitors from Vietnam as befits our traditions of hospitality. If some harm befalls them it is not good for the honour of our country.
						- “But following some communications with a Bhikkhu in Vietnam with one of our Bhikkhus, a wrong impression  has been created, there has been some problems caused to the lay Vietnamese persons who followed them.
						- “Some temples have also refused to accommodate them. So two of us from our temple decided to stay with them and help them until they leave our country and treat them with kindness and compassion (karuna and maithree).
						- A senior Sri Lankan monk had placed a whatsapp message which he said has caused problems for the group.
						- “Instead of writing whatsapp messages without inquiry, I appeal kindly to examine this matter and act in a way that preserves the dignity of our country,” the thero said.
						- “Our foreign service officials, and responsible monks should examine this matter and take the actions required for them to stay lawfully.

					- Meanwhile questions appeared to have been raised whether they could walk on the roads after coming on a tourist visa, the thero said. The ascetic is planning to go to Anuradhapura and to Jaffna, he said.
					- It is not clear what the problem is with walking using a tourist visa on a Buddhist trail, as other visitors go on Tea trails and Ramayana trails.
					- He is not known for preaching on his trip to India, and only sometimes answers questions.
					  collapsed:: true
						- “My journey is a lifelong walk,” the ascetic was quoted as saying by [VNExpress portal](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/pilgrim-spends-6-years-traversing-vietnam-on-foot-4747732.html) last May.  “I don’t intend to spread any message, as everything in Buddhism has been taught by the Buddha.
						- “I just want to practice per the teachings of the Buddha to complete myself. When I walk, I pray for everyone to always be happy with their families.”
						- The Vietnamese ascetic was staying the night on that day in a sawmill, and it was unseemly as there were 11,000 temples in Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan thero observed.
						- The ascetic however carries a bedroll with him and reportedly sleeps in forest patches and cemeteries among other places as he walks about in his own country.
					- Sri Lanka’s Aruna newspaper reported that the Chief Prelate of the Malwatte Chapter has written to the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs asking for an immigration inquiry.
					- The request has been triggered following a letter said to have been sent by a senior monk from a state recognized Buddhist order. Youtube videos showed the a copy of the letter, which was claimed to have been given by police to the group.

				- [April 18](https://www.lankaleader.lk/news/13098-itinerant-vietnamese-monk-meets-opposition-in-sri-lanka-from-a-fellow-monk): Itinerant Vietnamese monk meets opposition in Sri Lanka - from a fellow monk
					- Friday, 18 April 2025 12:16 ([RFA.org](https://www.rfa.org/))
					- A Vietnamese Buddhist monk on a barefoot pilgrimage from his homeland to India ran into some unexpected opposition in Sri Lanka on the latest leg of his circuitous journey around Asia.
					- A witness told Radio Free Asia that when the Vietnamese monk Thich Minh Tue and his entourage were about to go to a local Hindu temple to rest, _**a local monk**, claiming to be from the Sri Lankan Buddhist Sangha, came to the temple and **asked that he not stay**._
					- Local Sri Lankans objected, taking sides with their Vietnamese visitor.
					  The Sri Lankan monk then took out his phone and read the contents of a letter allegedly sent by Thich Nhat Tu, a representative of the state-backed Vietnam Buddhist Sangha – or religious association - to the Sri Lankan Sangha, to justify his demand that Thich Minh Tue leave the leafy temple compound in Giriulla, a town about 30 miles northeast of the capital Colombo.
					- “He pointed to the letter and read the content to prove that this group of monks are a fake monks and were violating the law,” said Nguyen Minh Chi, a Vietnamese filmmaker who witnessed the exchange.
					  collapsed:: true
						- The letter is visible in video and photos of the incident, filmed by YouTubers accompanying Thich Minh Tue.
						- RFA has not been able to verify the authenticity of the letter. It bears a signature and the name of Thich Nhat Tu, along with the seal of the International Buddhist Council of the Vietnamese sangha, for which he serves as deputy head.
						- Thich Minh Tue was eventually able to enter the temple.
						- He became an unlikely internet sensation last year in Vietnam, where his simple lifestyle has struck a chord. His barefoot walks went viral and well-wishers came out in droves.
						- Last December, he left Vietnam on a journey by foot to India, the birthplace of Buddhism. After crossing Laos, he entered Thailand with a plan to hike across conflict-wracked Myanmar, but ran into logistical and visa problems. He has since traveled to Malaysia, and a week ago arrived in Sri Lanka, a predominantly Buddhist nation. He still hopes to make it to India.
						- His expedition is not without controversy. Vietnam’s state-sanctioned Buddhist sangha has not officially recognized him as a monk. At one point, before his international wanderings began, authorities in communist Vietnam, leery of his popularity, announced he had “voluntarily retired.”
					- A statement was posted Wednesday on two Facebook pages linked to Thich Nhat Tu, the representative of the Vietnamese sangha, **denying he wrote the letter**.
					  collapsed:: true
						- It includes a section calling for close cooperation between the Vietnamese and Sri Lankan sanghas on the issue of Thich Minh Tue, saying that it is a matter related to “national order and security.”
						- One follower of Thich Minh Tue voiced exasperation about the controversy.
						- “Why do people who practice Buddhism together constantly fight each other?” asked Phuoc Nghiem in a video he posted Wednesday. “We’re only practicing (religion), but they keep filing complaints.”

					- April 18, 2025
					- The Most Venerable Thibbatuwawe Sri Sumangala Maha Thero, the Chief Prelate of the Malwatta Chapter, has issued a special letter to the Commissioner for Buddhist Affairs, urging immediate action to prevent the arrival of a group of Vietnamese monks previously deported from Thailand and Indonesia due to alleged anti-Buddhist activities. The Thero has also requested that the security forces be informed accordingly.
					  collapsed:: true
						- According to the letter, the group in question — including an individual named Lay An Tu — is accused of engaging in activities that are harmful to Buddhism. It is also noted that the organization they represent is banned in Vietnam. This information has been confirmed by Dr. Kiew Nhat Tu, Chairman of the International Buddhist Department of Ho Chi Minh City, who officially communicated the concerns to the Chief Prelate.
						- The letter highlights that the group is currently attempting to _enter Sri Lanka on **tourist visas** for pilgrimage purposes_. The Chief Prelate warns that such actions pose a serious threat to the sanctity of Buddhism and the public perception of Buddhist monks. He has therefore called for immediate measures to halt their activities, citing violations of visa regulations and the potential for reputational damage to Sri Lankan Buddhism on the international stage.
