				- Bản chất đều là sự mâu thuẫn giữa cái tưởng, cái mình cho rằng, cái mình mong cầu, với cái thực tế diễn ra. Nhưng nó ra 2 hiện tượng ngược nhau:

					- Copilot: This paradox is often referred to as [incongruity theory](((677e2ce9-2ac6-4763-a9f0-ffb37bd7cdca))) in humor studies.
					- Incongruity Theory:
					  id:: 677e2ce9-2ac6-4763-a9f0-ffb37bd7cdca
						- Definition: This theory suggests that humor arises when there is a disconnect or incongruity between what is expected and what actually occurs. The more serious or unexpected the context, the greater the contrast, and the funnier it becomes.
						- Paradox of Seriousness and Laughter: The seriousness of the initial situation heightens the incongruity when something funny happens, leading to more intense laughter. This intensification occurs both for the person who starts laughing and for those around them.
						- Example:
						  Imagine someone giving a very serious and formal speech, and suddenly something humorous happens, like a loud, unexpected noise. The stark contrast between the serious tone and the unexpected humor can cause an uncontrollable, infectious wave of laughter.

			- Google AI's story of the disciple Kai climbing the Mountain of Whispers
				- In a time when the teachings of the Great Master echoed through the valleys, a young disciple named Kai was known for his unwavering devotion, yet he often struggled with doubt. One day, the Master instructed him to ascend the solitary Mountain of Whispers, a place where the wind was said to carry the echoes of ancient wisdom.
				  Kai began his climb, the rocky path winding through dense forests, the air growing thinner with each step. As he ascended, the whispers began to fill his ears, not words, but feelings - a mix of joy, fear, longing, and despair. He tried to discern their meaning, but the mountain seemed to be testing him, revealing the raw emotions he had long suppressed.
				  Days turned into nights, and Kai was battered by storms, his body aching, his spirit wavering. He questioned his purpose, the whispers growing louder, taunting him with his inadequacies. On the verge of giving up, he stumbled upon a small cave, its entrance guarded by a lone, gnarled tree. Inside, he found an old, weathered scroll.
				  Unfurling it, Kai read the words of a forgotten sage: "The mountain does not test your strength, but your resolve. It reveals the truth within you, not the world outside." As he pondered these words, a sense of calm washed over him. He realized the whispers were not meant to frighten him, but to guide him towards self-understanding.
				  With renewed determination, Kai climbed the final stretch, reaching the summit. As he stood there, the world below seemed to stretch out endlessly, and the wind carried a new melody, a song of peace and clarity. He looked within himself, seeing his flaws, but also the strength of his spirit, the unwavering devotion that had brought him to this point.
				  Descending the mountain, Kai was no longer just a disciple, but a student of his own soul. He carried the lessons of the Mountain of Whispers with him, sharing his newfound understanding with others, proving that even the most challenging mountains can lead to the most profound revelations within oneself.
