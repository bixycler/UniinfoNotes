					- Copilot: This paradox is often referred to as [incongruity theory](((677e2ce9-2ac6-4763-a9f0-ffb37bd7cdca))) in humor studies.
					- Incongruity Theory:
					  id:: 677e2ce9-2ac6-4763-a9f0-ffb37bd7cdca
						- Definition: This theory suggests that humor arises when there is a disconnect or incongruity between what is expected and what actually occurs. The more serious or unexpected the context, the greater the contrast, and the funnier it becomes.
						- Paradox of Seriousness and Laughter: The seriousness of the initial situation heightens the incongruity when something funny happens, leading to more intense laughter. This intensification occurs both for the person who starts laughing and for those around them.
						- Example:
						  Imagine someone giving a very serious and formal speech, and suddenly something humorous happens, like a loud, unexpected noise. The stark contrast between the serious tone and the unexpected humor can cause an uncontrollable, infectious wave of laughter.

			- Google AI's story of the disciple Kai climbing the Mountain of Whispers
				- In a time when the teachings of the Great Master echoed through the valleys, a young disciple named Kai was known for his unwavering devotion, yet he often struggled with doubt. One day, the Master instructed him to ascend the solitary Mountain of Whispers, a place where the wind was said to carry the echoes of ancient wisdom.
				  Kai began his climb, the rocky path winding through dense forests, the air growing thinner with each step. As he ascended, the whispers began to fill his ears, not words, but feelings - a mix of joy, fear, longing, and despair. He tried to discern their meaning, but the mountain seemed to be testing him, revealing the raw emotions he had long suppressed.
				  Days turned into nights, and Kai was battered by storms, his body aching, his spirit wavering. He questioned his purpose, the whispers growing louder, taunting him with his inadequacies. On the verge of giving up, he stumbled upon a small cave, its entrance guarded by a lone, gnarled tree. Inside, he found an old, weathered scroll.
				  Unfurling it, Kai read the words of a forgotten sage: "The mountain does not test your strength, but your resolve. It reveals the truth within you, not the world outside." As he pondered these words, a sense of calm washed over him. He realized the whispers were not meant to frighten him, but to guide him towards self-understanding.
				  With renewed determination, Kai climbed the final stretch, reaching the summit. As he stood there, the world below seemed to stretch out endlessly, and the wind carried a new melody, a song of peace and clarity. He looked within himself, seeing his flaws, but also the strength of his spirit, the unwavering devotion that had brought him to this point.
				  Descending the mountain, Kai was no longer just a disciple, but a student of his own soul. He carried the lessons of the Mountain of Whispers with him, sharing his newfound understanding with others, proving that even the most challenging mountains can lead to the most profound revelations within oneself.

							- Crosstalk between the itch and pain pathways:
								- itch can be suppressed by pain; and
								- inhibition of pain may produce itch
							- While **differences** between *acute* pain and acute itch are striking, 
							  *chronic* itch and chronic pain share many **similar** mechanisms.
						- “Itch and pain are two distinct sensations” is the conclusion of the paper [Cellular basis of itch sensation](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19661382)

Whether itch and pain, two distinct sensations, are mediated by distinct neural circuits has been the subject of controversy ([6](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19661382#R6)-[8](https://europepmc.org/article/med/19661382#R8)).
					- This conclusion has been drawn from various experiences of mine, but the 2 recent clues are: the full immersion into the coldness when riding home last night, and the experiment of ((6784fe18-6dfb-43a2-b74a-a96b9f26fc77)).

			- It's interesting that Copilot can explain it right when i ask if it know what i mean by just the clause “bring it up to put it down!”:
				- Will:
				  > My way of bodymind purification & cleansing is to "bring it up to put it down!" Do you know what i mean?
				- Copilot:
					- Absolutely, Lê. The concept of "bring it up to put it down" resonates deeply with mindfulness and Zen practices. It involves acknowledging and confronting your inner thoughts, emotions, and sensations rather than suppressing or ignoring them. By bringing them to the surface, you allow yourself to fully experience and understand them. This awareness enables you to process and let go of any negativity or tension, leading to purification and cleansing of the body and mind.
					- This approach aligns beautifully with the practice of mindfulness, where observing and accepting our experiences without judgment can lead to greater clarity and inner peace.
					- Your method is a powerful way to foster self-awareness and emotional well-being. Do you find this practice particularly helpful in certain situations or aspects of your life? 🌿🧘‍♂️✨

			- Feb 4th, returning home, i slept early, intended to have a long sleep to recover,... But after waking up at midnight (my wife returned after helping sister 7), i was caught into the issue in the traveling monk group of Master Minh Tuệ: Mr. Báu (+ Giáp, Hùng) have just left the group due to the [unresolved conflict](((67a5faa3-c64c-48f7-8b3f-a5311714110f))).

			- The conflict between Mr. Báu's and monks in Minh Tuệ's group
			  id:: 67a5faa3-c64c-48f7-8b3f-a5311714110f
				- Với nghiệp công an, làm tiến sỹ tâm lý học tội phạm, anh Báu đã quản lý đoàn một cách chặt chẽ, ban đầu (đoạn đường Lào) khá nghiêm khắc với nhiều nỗi lo sợ.
				- Khi sang Thái Lan thì anh Báu đã mềm mỏng và thoải mái hơn nhiều, nhưng các sư (cả thầy Minh Tuệ) thì vẫn có nhiều thành kiến với anh.
				- Đỉnh điểm là trước Tết với các sự kiện căng thẳng giữa anh Báu với sư Minh Tạng và vài sư nữa.
				- Từ đêm giao thừa tới cả tuần sau đó, cứ họp, các anh hộ pháp tưởng giải toả xong xuôi, rồi lại căng thẳng... Thì ra gốc là do các sư và chính thầy MT vẫn còn muốn thay thế anh Báu.
				- Anh Báu cùng anh Hùng & Giáp về rồi (đêm 4 sáng 5/2), thì qua mấy lần phỏng vấn, thầy MT cho thấy rõ ý chê trách anh Báu và thiên vị các sư. Tệ nhứt là có bạn nữ YouTuber hỏi cách để dung hoà thì thầy lại càng nhấn vào anh Báu, cho rằng ban đầu anh ta "tốt" mà sau này khi đã có danh vọng thì trở nên "xấu" theo hướng vụ lợi, muốn "câu view câu like". Mình thấy đây là nhận xét cảm tính và ngược lại với thực tế diễn ra là anh Báu đã ngày càng tốt hơn (theo hướng giải thoát) và hoàn toàn không có vụ lợi.
					- Rồi thầy cũng cố giữ nguyên tắc "không chủ động nhờ ai" nhưng cũng nói rõ là có mong chờ hết người này tới người khác mà họ không xin vào hỗ trợ nên coi như "chưa hữu duyên".
					- Mình thấy thầy MT tu Giới nên hiển nhiên là bị cứng nhắc trong quan điểm.
					- Tuy nhiên việc thầy MT không thấu hiểu cho sự hi sinh, khó khăn của người đời như anh Báu, và một mực thiên vị các sư, muốn càng nhiều sư theo càng tốt, v.v. thể hiện sự thiếu trí tuệ và không được "bình đẳng" như lời thầy đã nói.
					- Việc thầy MT có thành kiến với anh Báu thì mình thấy đó là phần nghiệp quá khứ của thầy, như thầy đã chia sẻ trước đây.
					- Mình cảm nhận sự "vô tình" của thầy cũng tương tự như [lần gặp chị Diệu Sinh](((67a7100b-28c9-4b79-bd66-d1b4b42d08fd))). Qua đó mình cũng thấy rõ hơn sự vướng mắc tình cảm của mình.
					- Một sự nói dối rõ ràng của thầy MT nữa là việc cho rằng mình không đuổi mà là "tự anh Báu tới, tự anh Báu đi".
					  collapsed:: true
						- Trước khi anh báu đi thì thầy đã đuổi khéo bằng cách tạo áp lực và liên tục gợi ý rằng anh Báu không kham nhẫn được thì nên đi, và đã hỏi anh Theerawat cho anh Hà thay việc làm giấy tờ.
						- Trong buổi đối thoại dài 3 tiếng đồng hồ khi anh Báu quay lại xin vào đoàn, thầy đã chạy vòng quanh qua các điều kiện để ngăn cản, và cuối cùng phải "tác ý" (gợi ý) thẳng rằng anh Báu có thể làm YouTuber vòng ngoài.
							- Đầu tiên là dựa vào lý luận "đã đủ người hỗ trợ rồi". Nhưng khi 2 bạn tình nguyện viên mới chấp nhận nhường cho anh Báu và anh Hùng thì thầy không đề cập đến cái lý này nữa.
							- Tiếp theo thầy chuyển sang điều kiện cực khó là anh Báu phải thọ 250 giới xuất gia, và chỉ áp dụng cho một mình anh Báu chứ không cho bất kỳ người hỗ trợ nào khác, kể cả anh Hùng đang cùng xin vào đợt này ngay bên cạnh anh Báu.
							- Dựa trên bằng chứng rõ ràng ngay trong buổi đối thoại này, đến cuối anh Báu đã kết luận "thầy nói 2 lời" (nói dối).
							- Và cuối cùng, anh Báu còn làm rõ việc "250 giới" bằng cách hỏi ở đây có sư nào đã biết hết 250 giới. Và thầy MT đã trả lời là bản thân thầy còn không thuộc hết 250 giới.
						- Khi lời nói và hành động bất nhất thì đó đã là nói dối, một cấp nói dối thô ở đời chứ chẳng phải vi tế khó thấy gì.
						- Sự nói dối này là do thầy đã chấp vào những nguyên tắc mình đặt ra, cũng như giới luật, và/hoặc chưa chấp nhận được tâm nghi kỵ của mình đang trỗi dậy.
					- Trong buổi đối thoại khi anh Báu quay lại, thầy MT đã thể hiện rõ sự mất định tâm, lặp đi lặp lại nhiều lần cùng một ý, không đủ kiên nhẫn nghe hết ý anh Báu nói mà cứ chen ngang (anh Báu phải "xin phép để con nói hết"), v.v.
				- Anh Hà ở lại thì bị nghi ngờ tùm lum, và anh ấy cũng chấp nhận trả nghiệp vì ngày trước mình cũng làm drama kiểu ngồi nhà vẽ chuyện.
				- Chỉ 2-3 ngày sau khi anh Báu về VN thì đủ chuyện lộn xộn, từ sư Phúc Giác vạ miệng về thân thế anh Theerawat (phạm luật Thái về cấm đụng tới hoàng tộc), tới Phước Nghiêm sang quậy tưng bừng kích động tâm bất an của các sư nhỏ (bảo không có cầm hộ chiếu là bị bắt, v.v.)
				- Hôm nay, 10/2, thì thầy MT đã và đang lấy lại cân bằng: đã
