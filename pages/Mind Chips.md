		- Update notes: (done)
			- uninet may be mistaken with the omnifold, as a grand network of the whole Universe, due to its name. It's actually a universal network, but just a reflection of the omnifold on computer, not the whole. (This confusion appeared in one NotebookLM's audio overview)
				- Trinion (metaphysical) ~ Ω-thread (mathematical) ~ uninet (computer implementation)
				- In the future, if there is a need for a theory of uninet, it may be called "Uninet Theory", but now we just have uninets as instances of the Trinion implemented on computer.
			- Trinion, obop and qualiton are easily confused with each other.
				- Obop being & qualiton being are, just like all beings, instances of the Trinion.
				- Obop corresponds to the Equal component of the Trinion, and operates the Trinion using the CIE equation.
				- Qualiton is to quantum in Unithread as intent is to extent in the CIE formula. It's the "elementary particle" of intent/quality, hence the "smallest" instances of the Trinion.
				- In brief, Trinion -[Equal]-> obop -[intent]-> qualiton
				- Furthermore, the qualiton in uninet is called "autonoton".
			- Unïnfo can also capture the vague notion that "everything is information", which is _**not** a formal statement_ but can be sensed throughout the Unïnfo Theory.
				- That vague notion of the "universal information underlying everything" is formally modeled as the Ω-thread, which is again usually vaguely referred to as the "Unithread"! 😊
				- Formally, both Unïnfo and Unithread are the names of theories.
				- Formal concepts are the Trinion and the Ω-thread.
				- The whole Ω-thread is an instance of the Trinion, hence a **concrete thing**, i.e. a "being", but its partial chunks (segments called simply "threads") can represent anything, including the abstract concepts.
				- Each Ω-thread runs through the whole Ω (Omnifold = Universe) in a particular way corresponding to a particular configuration of the Universe.

		- Triangle inequality, balance restoration, intent resolution:
			- imbalance: c > i*e => driving force to restore balance
				- The log(c/(i*e)) is the thickness of the self wall. At equilibrium, the wall resolves.
			- balance: c = i*e, entropy max (reached limit resolution i0, round), action min (straight)
			- dynamic balance: the limit resolution i0 is just a threshold sustent which is very far from the next step in the ladder of infinite sustents. It's just the intent of a very large self, with a very thin self wall.
			- the law of the same content: all circles have the same content, their absolute crystallized content is 1, but their measured content (i*e) is always less than 1.

		- Huygens principle = intrinsic dynamic = light/effect flow (dynamic content) in space (static form) = change = self diff

			- mechanics & maths: 1st, Balance of Scale: The critical tiny movement of a scale’s arm (⚖️) tied to arm length and weight sparked the study of "moment of force" (torque) and other moments like moment of inertia,... Then, the study of balance ♎ leading to center of mass and many other measurements relating to the distribution of mass, esp. the moment of inertia which leads to the term "moment" in maths.
