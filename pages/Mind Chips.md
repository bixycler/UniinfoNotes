- An experiential witness of the Impermanence in... a dream! 😎
	- [My life is a dream, my dream is alive!](https://creatzynotes.blogspot.com/2011/12/my-life-is-dream-my-dreams-are-alive.html)
	- Although the “dream” is usually used as a metaphor for the unreal, my literal dream has shown a very realistic realization of the whole life!
	- To the world outside of the dream, the dream is so illusionary, but to the dream, the outside world is no less illusionary. Hence, both of them are as real as illusionary 😜👻! In other words, everything is a **real illusion**.
		- 🌀 Real Illusion
			- The illusion is real. Literally.
			- Not just metaphorically — it exists, it appears, it affects — that’s a real being with real effects.
			- The unreality of the illusion is just its way of being. And its being is real.
			- The Real Illusion is just another name for the [Liar Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox).
	- The gatha of [Diamond sutra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Sutra):
		- > तारका तिमिरं दीपो मायावश्यायबुद्बुदं। सुपिनं विद्युदभ्रं च एवं द्रष्टव्यं संस्कृतं।
			- Như sao đêm, như mắt loạn, như ngọn đèn, như huyễn thuật, như sương mai, như bọt nước, như cơn mộng, như ánh chớp, như đám mây — những gì hữu vi nên được quán chiếu như vậy.
		- > 一切有爲法
		  如夢幻泡影
		  如露亦如電
		  應作如是觀
			- > Nhất thiết hữu vi pháp
			  Như mộng huyễn bào ảnh
			  Như lộ diệc như điện
			  Ưng tác như thị quán.
			- Tất cả pháp hữu vi
			  Như mộng ảo, bọt bóng 
			  Như sương sa, chớp lóe
			  Nên quán sát như vậy.

- Accept–Release
	- Accept the form as is, release the grasp, and let the thread flow.
	- accept → release → flow:
	- Let it be → Let it go → Let it flow
		- My common saying: Let it go, let it flow!
- 🌊 Flow + 🌱 Form = 🌺 Flower  
  “The flower is the moment the flow takes form.”
	- Word play: “flower” = “flow-er” = flowing being
	- In Japanese culture, the word “flower” (花, hana) is deeply symbolic with not only beauty, but also transience, and the ephemeral nature of life.
		- Mono no aware (物の哀れ) – “The pathos of things”
		- Ikebana (生け花) – “Living flowers”
		- Kado (花道) – “The Way of the Flower”

- Thread theory of sound
	- A complex tone is like a bundle of overtones (threads), and [pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)) is the **greatest common factor** — the shared cycle
	- Just like SCIFER finds the deepest **common structure** in seemingly separate threads, the ear finds the deepest common cycle among frequencies — the perceived pitch. This is shown best in the complex tones [missing fundamental frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_fundamental).
	- Đàn bầu is played soley with [flageolet tones (pinched harmonics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_harmonic), which is an advanced technique on other instruments like violin, guitar, etc.
		- The sound is pure, glassy, and floating, because it's made entirely from string harmonics — no pressed tones. That’s why the đàn bầu sounds so “airy” and “spiritual”.

			- point: seen from the outside
			- bulk of content c: differentiated but orderless
			- Omnifold c/i: ordered by the direction of intent i
				- The omnifold is the unit hyper-box
				- Different intents see different omnifolds of the same bulk c (const)
			- ohm-thread: unfolded into a circle
				- The space is extended from the unit hyper-box
			- ohm-plane: projected into the view cone of i
			- ohm-pipe: extended in time (axis of i)

		- Law of "the same content in different forms"
			- const = |content| = radius
			- phase = state = configuration of content = internal form
			- circle = trajectory = extension = external form
			- wave = transition between internal form & external form
			- round circle = "uniform distribution" config = all quanta of content have the same phase = straight radius
				- in unwrapped phase plane: vertical straight bar of radius (space) slides horizontally along phase (time) axis
		- "⏰ posture" = positions of its hands, just like a person with 2 hands.

		- Update notes: (done)
			- uninet may be mistaken with the omnifold, as a grand network of the whole Universe, due to its name. It's actually a universal network, but just a reflection of the omnifold on computer, not the whole. (This confusion appeared in one NotebookLM's audio overview)
				- Trinion (metaphysical) ~ Ω-thread (mathematical) ~ uninet (computer implementation)
				- In the future, if there is a need for a theory of uninet, it may be called "Uninet Theory", but now we just have uninets as instances of the Trinion implemented on computer.
			- Trinion, obop and qualiton are easily confused with each other.
				- Obop being & qualiton being are, just like all beings, instances of the Trinion.
				- Obop corresponds to the Equal component of the Trinion, and operates the Trinion using the CIE equation.
				- Qualiton is to quantum in Unithread as intent is to extent in the CIE formula. It's the "elementary particle" of intent/quality, hence the "smallest" instances of the Trinion.
				- In brief, Trinion -[Equal]-> obop -[intent]-> qualiton
				- Furthermore, the qualiton in uninet is called "autonoton".
			- Unïnfo can also capture the vague notion that "everything is information", which is _**not** a formal statement_ but can be sensed throughout the Unïnfo Theory.
				- That vague notion of the "universal information underlying everything" is formally modeled as the Ω-thread, which is again usually vaguely referred to as the "Unithread"! 😊
				- Formally, both Unïnfo and Unithread are the names of theories.
				- Formal concepts are the Trinion and the Ω-thread.
				- The whole Ω-thread is an instance of the Trinion, hence a **concrete thing**, i.e. a "being", but its partial chunks (segments called simply "threads") can represent anything, including the abstract concepts.
				- Each Ω-thread runs through the whole Ω (Omnifold = Universe) in a particular way corresponding to a particular configuration of the Universe.

		- Triangle inequality, balance restoration, intent resolution:
			- imbalance: c > i*e => driving force to restore balance
				- The log(c/(i*e)) is the thickness of the self wall. At equilibrium, the wall resolves.
			- balance: c = i*e, entropy max (reached limit resolution i0, round), action min (straight)
			- dynamic balance: the limit resolution i0 is just a threshold sustent which is very far from the next step in the ladder of infinite sustents. It's just the intent of a very large self, with a very thin self wall.
			- the law of the same content: all circles have the same content, their absolute crystallized content is 1, but their measured content (i*e) is always less than 1.

			- 2. Last experience of the dead state
			- 3. Previous realization of time to shift from target aiming to restarting
			  => Maybe this is the last thing i must release: the vision

			- 2. ♎, balance, cancellation, for sustent

		- Spirorus = divergence (inner flow + polar wave) + curl particle
		- Huygens principle = intrinsic dynamic = light/effect flow (dynamic content) in space (static form) = change = self diff
		- effect flow + projective thread (distribution) = wave equation = Newton mechanics = momentum conservation = reciprocal forces between content & form (Newton 3rd law)
		- average = center = balance ⚖️ = zero sum = target of (min sum optimization = restoring force) = bottom of potential well
		- n-th derivative (in time) = n-th moment (in space) ?! ==> chain of intents in particle = cone of extents in field (wave)
		- About "moments" from "momentum = movement":
			- now = the current moment = ever moving flow
			- mechanics & maths: 1st, Balance of Scale: The critical tiny movement of a scale’s arm (⚖️) tied to arm length and weight sparked the study of "moment of force" (torque) and other moments like moment of inertia,... Then, the study of balance ♎ leading to center of mass and many other measurements relating to the distribution of mass, esp. the moment of inertia which leads to the term "moment" in maths.
