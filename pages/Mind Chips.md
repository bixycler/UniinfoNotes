		- The tour into the universe of Unithread:
			- point: seen from the outside
			- bulk of content c: differentiated but orderless
			- Omnifold c/i: ordered by the direction of intent i
				- The omnifold is the unit hyper-box
				- Different intents see different omnifolds of the same bulk c (const)
			- ohm-thread: unfolded into a circle
				- The space is extended from the unit hyper-box
			- ohm-plane: projected into the view cone of i
			- ohm-pipe: extended in time (axis of i)
				- AKA ohm-current: shown with sine waves

		- Law of "the same content in different forms"
			- const = |content| = radius
			- phase = state = configuration of content = internal form
			- circle = trajectory = extension = external form
			- wave = transition between internal form & external form
			- round circle = "uniform distribution" config = all quanta of content have the same phase = straight radius
				- in unwrapped phase plane: vertical straight bar of radius (space) slides horizontally along phase (time) axis
		- "⏰ posture" = positions of its hands, just like a person with 2 hands.
			- "clock hands" is from "pointing hands" 👆 focusing on its functionality
			- "clock arms" is from the overall shape of a body with two limbs 💪.
				- the spade ♠️ at the end of the arm resembles the pointing hand 👆

			- Tree = root system + shoot system = double cone
			- obop = herenow = mixer of content to produce new forms
