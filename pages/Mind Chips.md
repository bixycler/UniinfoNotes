  - The [middle way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Way) which most people see, represented by the yellow diamond shape in the image, is the “just right” state—neither lacking (Yin) nor excessive (Yang). It’s a comfortable balance, neither cold nor hot, free from greed (due to lack, Yin) and aversion (anger, haste, Yang)... but this leads to delusion, becoming infatuated with that comfortable balance.
  - Nirvana, or liberation, is the black area at the bottom center, where the “meditating Buddha” sits. It’s also a balance... but a **dynamic balance** amid infinite turbulence, not a static balanced land like the yellow diamond above.
  - The common path to liberation involves using the yellow land in the middle above to distance oneself from the two extremes first, then gradually practicing to descend into the turbulent jungle below where the “meditating Buddha” sits.
  - This oasis is on the “edge of chaos”, i.e. the border between 2 extremes of completely static (Yin) and completely random (Yang).
  - The trip [zooming into the edge of chaos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/33w9EPJsk5MsAcaG6): 
    - From a distance, it looks like a single straight line clearly dividing Yin and Yang.
    - As we move closer, we see it’s not like that at all, but filled with patterns of “Yin within Yang, Yang within Yin, and even androgyny” within it, ☯️.
    - And deep inside, amidst the dense, turbulent jungles, there is a “Buddha meditating” in the midst of that forest 🧘‍♀️.
- 3 poisons in sex
  - Initially, there is greed: a feeling of lacking the other side stimulates desire, leading one to rush toward the partner and pull the partner into oneself.
  - Near the peak, there is aversion: when energy has accumulated fully within, especially in men, there’s an urge to release it explosively (reaching climax). If interrupted at this stage, one feels irritated, frustrated, and restless, regardless of gender, due to excess Yang. Men tend to exhibit this aversion more clearly as anger, while women often experience it more subtly as inner restlessness.
  - After orgasm, there is delusion: when the two sides come together intensely and explode, Yin and Yang harmonize, resulting in satisfaction, fullness—neither lacking (greed) nor excessive (aversion)... but also no clear mind (delusion). Thus, one embraces that blissful feeling, holding it tightly in the heart while sleeping.
  - During this sleep, delusion reveals its nature of ignorance (stupidity): one is content with the pleasure and cares about nothing else, simply rolling over to sleep. Then, upon waking and opening the eyes to see and know, delusion manifests as infatuation, indulgence, obsession and attachment: having embraced that pleasure and embedded it deeply into the subconscious (during sleep), one now clings to it heavily, with everything one does aimed at recreating that pleasure without awareness.
- Trong 1 cuộc làm tình thì cả 2 đều trải qua quy trình tham - sân - si: 
  - ban đầu là tham: cảm giác thiếu thốn phần bên kia kích thích sự ham muốn, nên muốn lao vào đối phương và kéo đối phương vào mình;
  - khi lên cao trào là sân: khi năng lượng đã tích tụ đầy trong người, nhất là người nam, thì bị thôi thúc phải cho nó bùng nổ ra (lên đỉnh). Ai bị ngắt ngang ở đoạn này thì sẽ bị tức tối bực bội, bứt rứt đứng ngồi không yên do quá dương, bất kể nam nữ. Nam thì thường bị sân rõ hơn thành nóng giận, còn nữ thường nhẹ hơn thành bứt rứt trong người.
  - sau cực khoái là si: khi 2 bên xáp lại cực độ để bùng nổ xong thì âm dương hòa hợp, thỏa mãn, đầy đủ, không thiếu (tham) không thừa (sân)... nhưng cũng không thấy đường (si), nên ôm cái khoái cảm đó vào lòng bó chặt nó trong tâm mà ngủ. 
  - Lúc ngủ này thì si thể hiện bản chất vô minh (ngu si), ta sướng là được rồi không cần quan tâm gì nữa hết, lăn ra ngủ. Nhưng sau đó, lúc thức dậy mở mắt ra để thấy biết thì si thể hiện ra ở chỗ "si mê": do mình đã ôm cái sướng đó cài sâu nó vào trong vô thức (lúc ngủ), nên giờ mình chấp nó một cách nặng nề, mọi thứ mình làm đều chỉ để tìm lại cái sướng đó mà không biết.

			- point: seen from the outside
			- bulk of content c: differentiated but orderless
			- Omnifold c/i: ordered by the direction of intent i

			- circle = trajectory = extension = external form
			- wave = transition between internal form & external form
			- round circle = "uniform distribution" config = all quanta of content have the same phase = straight radius

		- Update notes: (done)
			- uninet may be mistaken with the omnifold, as a grand network of the whole Universe, due to its name. It's actually a universal network, but just a reflection of the omnifold on computer, not the whole. (This confusion appeared in one NotebookLM's audio overview)
				- Trinion (metaphysical) ~ Ω-thread (mathematical) ~ uninet (computer implementation)
				- In the future, if there is a need for a theory of uninet, it may be called "Uninet Theory", but now we just have uninets as instances of the Trinion implemented on computer.
			- Trinion, obop and qualiton are easily confused with each other.
				- Obop being & qualiton being are, just like all beings, instances of the Trinion.
				- Obop corresponds to the Equal component of the Trinion, and operates the Trinion using the CIE equation.
				- Qualiton is to quantum in Unithread as intent is to extent in the CIE formula. It's the "elementary particle" of intent/quality, hence the "smallest" instances of the Trinion.
				- In brief, Trinion -[Equal]-> obop -[intent]-> qualiton
				- Furthermore, the qualiton in uninet is called "autonoton".
			- Unïnfo can also capture the vague notion that "everything is information", which is _**not** a formal statement_ but can be sensed throughout the Unïnfo Theory.
				- That vague notion of the "universal information underlying everything" is formally modeled as the Ω-thread, which is again usually vaguely referred to as the "Unithread"! 😊
				- Formally, both Unïnfo and Unithread are the names of theories.
				- Formal concepts are the Trinion and the Ω-thread.
				- The whole Ω-thread is an instance of the Trinion, hence a **concrete thing**, i.e. a "being", but its partial chunks (segments called simply "threads") can represent anything, including the abstract concepts.
				- Each Ω-thread runs through the whole Ω (Omnifold = Universe) in a particular way corresponding to a particular configuration of the Universe.

		- Triangle inequality, balance restoration, intent resolution:
			- imbalance: c > i*e => driving force to restore balance
				- The log(c/(i*e)) is the thickness of the self wall. At equilibrium, the wall resolves.
			- balance: c = i*e, entropy max (reached limit resolution i0, round), action min (straight)
			- dynamic balance: the limit resolution i0 is just a threshold sustent which is very far from the next step in the ladder of infinite sustents. It's just the intent of a very large self, with a very thin self wall.
			- the law of the same content: all circles have the same content, their absolute crystallized content is 1, but their measured content (i*e) is always less than 1.

			- 2. Last experience of the dead state

Then, the study of balance ♎ leading to center of mass and many other measurements relating to the distribution of mass, esp. the moment of inertia which leads to the term "moment" in maths.
