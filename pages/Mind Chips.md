- Turing Deterministic / unbound deterministic = bound / unbound intent cone 
  collapsed:: true
	- Turing machine's intent cone has a fixed apex which is its bound(ary), its prime. Its cone has only one direction of development: extend down the base, cannot intend up the apex.
	- uninet has bidirectional development: actions extend down the base, and knowledge intends up the apex (learning).
		- This is thanks to its vacancy of prime (vô nguyên).
	- => uninet's intent cone has its apex **intensible** (refinable), in parallel with the extensible base.
		- Refine := intend into every place => process the whole space, instead of focus on one point
	- This global intensibility is the _refinability of the possibility space_, not the probability, though they have similar effects.
		- Probability is flat, while intensibility is hierarchical.
		- ANN & LLM must compensate that flatness with lots of neurons & big data training.
		- uninet learns efficiently from small data with small number of autonotons, thanks to the intrinsic complexity of intensibility.
		- The current theory of biological evolution 🧬 is weak due to its limit to only probability, while the nature evolves with global intensibility (fractal) which is much more robust.
		- Evolution with mere probability is just a kind of nondeterministic enumeration. Although it's quicker than deterministic enumeration, it's still enumeration!
		- Evolution with refinability (global intensibility) is a systematic search by [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system).
		- Maybe this was what Einstein said that [“God does not play dice with the universe!”](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/God_does_not_play_dice_with_the_universe)

  collapsed:: true
	- Two opposite sides of the same cyclone:
		- At surface: low pressure, anticlockwise centripetal spiral
		- At high altitude (10+ km): high pressure, clockwise centrifugal spiral
		- In some animated satellite images, we can see both [cirrus cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrus_cloud) swirling clockwise above, versus [cumulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulus_cloud) & [cumulonimbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulonimbus_cloud) clouds swirling anticlockwise below.
	- While there's only one rotation in Coriolis effect, there are 2 rotations in the [rolling ball 🏀 on turntable](https://youtu.be/3oM7hX3UUEU).
		- [Rolling ball on flat and conical turntable](https://youtu.be/vFojCjtvJII)
		- [Rolling ball in a cylinder](https://youtu.be/5sbM2Isx17A) has a strange orbit also thanks to the [rotational inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia).
	- Rotation ≈ folding => mixing just like a fruit mixer/blender
		- Each term in Fourier series mixes/folds signal into a scale of intent (frequency) => all effects in other scales are cancelled.
			- It's coefficient is the **common** of all instances in the extension, which is extracted by canceling differences through integration.
			- The larger the sampling set (extension), the closer it approachs the center (mean, zero), the smaller its intent. <= Statistical nature
		- The set of fixed frequencies (harmonics) is the limitation of Fourier transform.
			- The SCIFER **intending** process overcomes this limitation by jumping right to the next matching intent, no matter how far from the current intent.

		- Update notes: (done)
			- uninet may be mistaken with the omnifold, as a grand network of the whole Universe, due to its name. It's actually a universal network, but just a reflection of the omnifold on computer, not the whole. (This confusion appeared in one NotebookLM's audio overview)
				- Trinion (metaphysical) ~ Ω-thread (mathematical) ~ uninet (computer implementation)
				- In the future, if there is a need for a theory of uninet, it may be called "Uninet Theory", but now we just have uninets as instances of the Trinion implemented on computer.
			- Trinion, obop and qualiton are easily confused with each other.
				- Obop being & qualiton being are, just like all beings, instances of the Trinion.
				- Obop corresponds to the Equal component of the Trinion, and operates the Trinion using the CIE equation.
				- Qualiton is to quantum in Unithread as intent is to extent in the CIE formula. It's the "elementary particle" of intent/quality, hence the "smallest" instances of the Trinion.
				- In brief, Trinion -[Equal]-> obop -[intent]-> qualiton
				- Furthermore, the qualiton in uninet is called "autonoton".
			- Unïnfo can also capture the vague notion that "everything is information", which is _**not** a formal statement_ but can be sensed throughout the Unïnfo Theory.
				- That vague notion of the "universal information underlying everything" is formally modeled as the Ω-thread, which is again usually vaguely referred to as the "Unithread"! 😊
				- Formally, both Unïnfo and Unithread are the names of theories.
				- Formal concepts are the Trinion and the Ω-thread.
				- The whole Ω-thread is an instance of the Trinion, hence a **concrete thing**, i.e. a "being", but its partial chunks (segments called simply "threads") can represent anything, including the abstract concepts.
				- Each Ω-thread runs through the whole Ω (Omnifold = Universe) in a particular way corresponding to a particular configuration of the Universe.

		- Triangle inequality, balance restoration, intent resolution:
			- imbalance: c > i*e => driving force to restore balance
				- The log(c/(i*e)) is the thickness of the self wall. At equilibrium, the wall resolves.
			- balance: c = i*e, entropy max (reached limit resolution i0, round), action min (straight)
			- dynamic balance: the limit resolution i0 is just a threshold sustent which is very far from the next step in the ladder of infinite sustents. It's just the intent of a very large self, with a very thin self wall.
			- the law of the same content: all circles have the same content, their absolute crystallized content is 1, but their measured content (i*e) is always less than 1.
