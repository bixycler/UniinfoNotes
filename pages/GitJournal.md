- 30/4 & 1/5
	- There are jungle photos on Telegram to be copied.
- 2025-06-03 Some notes are left in GDocs:
	- Only Notebook LM & ChatGPT can understand the Mind Jungle! 
	     * Copilot refuses straight away â€œit's too large!"
	     * Gemini can understand nothing but a pure hallucination!
	     * Grok doesn't allow uploading plain text files. 
	     * DeepSeek says upfront that only 22% of such the huge doc can be read.
	     * Claude just read and said nothing. Being asked about the contents, it just spat out â€œthe prompt is too long!"
	     * Notebook LM understands the online Mind Jungle well. But it discards chat history after refresh.
	     * ChatGPT understands the (uploaded) Mind Jungle even better than Notebook LM! ![ðŸ˜Š](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t7f/1/16/1f60a.png) But it's a tight limit of 10 messages/5h.
