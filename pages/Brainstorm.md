					- the differential form $œâ$ captures the flow on/through the boundary $‚àÇŒ©$ of the orientable manifold $Œ©$.
				- circular flow: source $dœâ$ = curl $‚àá√óF$ of vector field $F$
					- flow on $‚àÇŒ©$: in 1D, it's a simple 1-form $œâ_1 = \mathbf{F}‚ãÖd\mathbf{r} = F_x dx + F_y dy + F_z dz$
						- in higher dimensions, the ($n-1$)-form is difficult to formulate,

				- diverging flow: source $dœâ$ = divergence $‚àá‚ãÖF$ of vector field $F$
					- flow through $‚àÇŒ©$ is an ($n-1$)-form which is Hodge dual of the 1-form, 
					  e.g. $œâ_{3-1} = ‚ãÜœâ_1 = ‚ãÜ(\mathbf{F}‚ãÖd\mathbf{r}) = \mathbf{F}‚ãÖ(‚ãÜd\mathbf{r}) = F_x‚ãÖ dy‚àßdz + F_y‚ãÖ dz‚àßdx + F_z‚ãÖ dx‚àßdy$
				- [Green's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem#Relationship_to_the_divergence_theorem) beautifully captures both curl and divergence by simply turning the basis a right angle: $(dx, dy)$ for curl ‚Üí $(dy, -dx)$ for divergence.
				- When $Œ©$ is 1D, i.e. a line segment, this becomes the fundamental theorem of calculus: 
				  $\int_{a}^b{df} = \int_{a,b}{f} = f(b) - f(a)$
				- Considering zeros & poles of $f(z)$ on the complex plane to be sources, we can prove the [fundamental theorem of algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra), by counting [winding number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winding_number) of $f(C)$ for the circle $|z| = R$ with $R: 0 ‚Üí ‚àû$.

					- Here, $P_D$ is the ‚Äúparallelized point‚Äù of $D$, i.e., $ABCP_D$ is the parallelogram erected from the triangle $ABC$.
						- That means $DP_D$ is the deviation of $ABCD$ from the parallelogram $ABCP_D$.
					- When $M, N$ are midpoints of the two diagonals $AC, BD$, then $DP_D = 2MN$, and we have another formula:
					  $AB^2 + BC^2 + CD^2 + DA^2 = AC^2 + BD^2 + (2MN)^2$

			- **Perspective Flip**: Something "falling from heaven" is a good opportunity for humans down on Earth. The closing outside, like a black hole or a closing of a day, is the opening inside, like a white hole or an opening of a night.
			- **Convergence for Explosion**: The closing isn‚Äôt just a negative end (death, decline); it‚Äôs a convergence of conditions, like a sunset or a black hole collapsing externally, that sets the stage for an "explosion" of opportunity, like a sunrise or a white hole opening internally, a preparation for new beginnings (reborn, germination).
			- **Transformative Technique**: This flip can be applied as a mindset‚Äîviewing a "closing" (e.g., a failure or end) not as a negative end but as a convergence point that prepares for a new "opening" (e.g., a fresh start or opportunity).

			- Copilot suggests "spooling" & "entwining".
			  collapsed:: true
				- While "entwining" is good for its broad sense, "spooling" is good for its common usage in computing and capturing both "spooling in" and "spooling out".
				- For a thick coil with many loops in between, "spooling" is a great term which can be combined with "rolling": at the two ends, the thread is "spooled in/out", while in between, it just rolls/rotates around.
				- I'm thinking of the new term ‚Äúspool-rolling‚Äù or ‚Äúsprolling‚Äù /sprol.…™≈ã/ to combine ‚Äúspooling‚Äù & ‚Äúrolling‚Äù!
					- While ‚Äú[rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling) = rotation + translation‚Äù, ‚Äúsprolling = winding + translation‚Äù
					- The slang ‚Äú[sproll](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sproll)‚Äù can be ‚Äúspin + roll‚Äù or ‚Äúspam + troll‚Äù.
					- Don't be confused with ‚Äúsprawling‚Äù /spr…îÀêl.…™≈ã/
					- Related to the hot ‚Äúrolling spool‚Äù.

			- For a single loop ‚û∞ and when it degenerates into just a (soliton) wave packet, its motion is the combination between the "propagation" in the direction of the the main thread and the "curling in & out" of the loop/packet.
			- In general, there are 3 parts of this movement: thread input, rotating inside, and thread output.
				- In Unithread view, all [bodies](((66c810a0-9861-4787-bdcf-1378219332be))) in the worlds, from celestial bodies, organisms (thread = food & info), to simple physical objects (thread = energy), are "living" (existing) by this movement. The difference is just how complicated the "rotation" inside that body is.
				- I think ‚Äú**transcycling** = cycling + translation‚Äù should be an apt term for this general movement.
					- ‚Äútranscycling = cycling + exchange (I/O)‚Äù: the bicycle cycling, itself, includes the translation of the bicycle and the exchange of momentum, but i add the prefix ‚Äútrans‚Äù to stress the intrinsic exchange of content, transition of state, transformation of thread.
					- Verb ‚Äúto transcycle‚Äù: When an obop transcycles *on/along* the thread from left to right, it transcycles the thread through its body and effectively makes the thread move from right to left relative to the obop.

							- Passive voice: ‚Äúsomething is transcycled through somebody‚Äù ~ ‚Äúsomething is cycled through somebody‚Äù ~ ‚Äúsomebody cycles through something's contents‚Äù (e.g. ‚ÄúThe Earth climate cycles through the warm El Ni√±o phase, the neutral phase and the cool La Ni√±a phase.‚Äù )
				- ‚Äútranscycling‚Äù is close to ‚Äútraversal‚Äù, with ‚Äúcycle‚Äù ~ ‚Äúverse = turn‚Äù!
					- ((678b72d3-073a-4763-a49f-5233a3d86614))
					- The ‚Äúturn‚Äù in ‚Äútraversal‚Äù is the change (nearly reverse) of direction in the zigzag course or switchback: to exhaustively traverse a flat space, we must switchback many times.
						- A milder ‚Äúturn‚Äù is the ‚Äúturn away‚Äù (nearly perpendicularly) from the main direction of the flow/river/road to **cross over** it, i.e. the original meaning of the Latin verb ‚Äú[traversare](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/traversare)‚Äù.
					- ‚Äúturn‚Äù ~ ‚Äúrotate‚Äù: in maths, ‚Äúturn = cycle‚Äù like ‚Äú[turn of rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(knot)) = round loop of rope‚Äù, ‚Äú[1 turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle)) = 1 cycle‚Äù 1œÑ = 2œÄ
