			- [Schwartz distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)) with action on a test function projecting the whole test function into a number, usually through integration.
				- Example of distributions: Heaviside step function $H(x)$ --[distributional derivative]--> Dirac delta function $Œ¥(x)$.
				- Distributional derivative: $T'[œÜ] = - T[œÜ']$
				  Action of derivative distribution $T'$ on test function $œÜ$ is minus action of original distribution $T$ on derivative of test function $œÜ'$.

				  Distribution of energy ($T_{ŒºŒΩ}$) $\sim$ distribution of space ($g_{ŒºŒΩ}$)
				  $Œ∫ T_{ŒºŒΩ} = (Œõ - \frac{1}{2} R) g_{ŒºŒΩ} + R_{ŒºŒΩ}$
					- Tensors
						- $T_{ŒºŒΩ}$: [stress‚Äìenergy tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor) representing the distribution of matter and energy
						- $g_{ŒºŒΩ}$: [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor_(general_relativity)) defining the geometric properties of spacetime, such as distances, angles, curvatures, etc.
						- $R_{ŒºŒΩ},\,R$: [Ricci curvature tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_curvature) and [Ricci scalar curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_curvature) derived from the metric tensor $g_{ŒºŒΩ}$ in a complicated manner
							- Ricci curvatures (tensor & scalar) are contractions of [Riemann curvature tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_curvature_tensor):
							  $R_{ŒºŒΩ} = g^{ab} R_{aŒºbŒΩ} \;;\; R = g^{ŒºŒΩ} R_{ŒºŒΩ} = 2 K = 2 Œ∫_1 Œ∫_2$
							- $K$: [Gaussian curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature)
							- $Œ∫_1,\, Œ∫_2$: [principal curvatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_curvature)
					- Constants
						- $Œ∫ = \frac{8œÄG}{c^4} ‚âà 2.07665 √ó 10^{-43}\,{\textrm N}^{-1}$: Einstein gravitational constant
						- $G$: gravitational constant
						- $c$: speed of light
						- $Œõ$: [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant)
				- The Einstein field equation is so complicated with all kinds of tensors and curvatures! ü´§
				  id:: 67bdb94a-e172-43f9-a59e-a97756fef1f4
				- Einstein use curvature to refer to spacetime warping because it's crutial in General Relativity: [curvature = force](((67b5c77d-c42c-4dc5-8d47-fd82f535177a))) in [equivalence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle) and various curvatures in ((67bdaa5e-66c0-4874-8ca6-95032208e06d)).
				- However, the spacetime distribution represented by its density is much more intuitive and more fundamental, which is defined directly by the metric tensor.
					- Spacetime distortion of proper spacetime when projected onto a flat Cartesian coordinate system:
						- *Compression/Contraction*: Proper distance/interval at the herenow is greater than the coordinate distance/interval observed by an external observer.
						- *Stretch/Dilation*: Proper distance/interval at the herenow is less than the coordinate distance/interval observed by an external observer.
					- Spacetime distribution around a massive object, like the Sun üåû, as shown in [Schwarzschild metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric)
						- Proper distance ($ds$) and proper time interval ($dœÑ$) in spherical coordinates $(t, r, Œ∏, œÜ)$ with signature convention¬†(+, -, -, -)
						  $${ds}^2 = c^2 {dœÑ}^2 \;=\; ( 1 - \frac{R_s}{r} )c^2 {dt}^2 \; - ( 1 - \frac{R_s}{r} )^{-1} dr^2 \; - r^2 {dŒ©}^2$$
						  with ${dŒ©}^2 = ({dŒ∏}^2 + (\sin Œ∏)^2 {dœÜ}^2)$ and [Schwarzschild radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius) $R_s = {2GM}/{c^2}$
						- **Stretch/dilation** of time: The coefficient $(1 - R_s/r)$ of  ${dt}^2$ is large near the Sun. This means that proper time intervals are shorter than coordinate time intervals.
						- **Compression/contraction** of radial distances: The coefficient $(1 - R_s/r)^{-1}$ of ${dr}^2$ is small near the Sun. This means that proper radial distances are greater than coordinate radial distances.

			- The linkage is due to [stagger = dependent origination](((67b541c9-befb-46b8-b2ae-e6e251043153))) and the [mismatch between circles](((67b541cb-a5c9-4634-b5f7-080d367faa4c))).
				- stagger is to momentum ~ [distortion is to force/curvature](((67b541d0-9e59-42ec-9199-9e9e114579e8)))
			- All the three parts of ((67a98760-71fa-4033-9c42-f3025d632d04)), i.e. input, output, internal bridge/cycle, are continued by staggering.
				- Output: integral/accumulation form higher derivative to lower level = action = projection outward from potential to actual = actualization = extension (from empty to solid, from abstract to concrete)
				- Input: differentiation/derivation from lover to higher level = attraction = observation = learning
				- Bridge: innermost bridge between inward & outward flow = equal = driver = switcher/chooser = free will
					- Fineness of this bridge = 1/size of self = degree of freedom

			- I'm discussing with Copilot, but the right image is blocked because it's "too sensitive!" üòØüòß
			  collapsed:: true
				- Maybe it looks like a crotch ü§î?!
				- I just want to make it clear that the circle is a loop ‚û∞, not separate from the thread.
			- Copilot suggests "spooling" & "entwining".
			  collapsed:: true
				- While "entwining" is good for its broad sense, "spooling" is good for its common usage in computing and capturing both "spooling in" and "spooling out".
				- For a thick coil with many loops in between, "spooling" is a great term which can be combined with "rolling": at the two ends, the thread is "spooled in/out", while in between, it just rolls/rotates around.
				- I'm thinking of the new term ‚Äúspool-rolling‚Äù or ‚Äúsprolling‚Äù /sprol.…™≈ã/ to combine ‚Äúspooling‚Äù & ‚Äúrolling‚Äù!
					- While ‚Äú[rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling) = rotation + translation‚Äù, ‚Äúsprolling = winding + translation‚Äù
					- The slang ‚Äú[sproll](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sproll)‚Äù can be ‚Äúspin + roll‚Äù or ‚Äúspam + troll‚Äù.
					- Don't be confused with ‚Äúsprawling‚Äù /spr…îÀêl.…™≈ã/
					- Related to the hot ‚Äúrolling spool‚Äù.
						- [Rolling and pulling](https://leancrew.com/all-this/2023/06/rolling-and-pulling/)
						- [The surprising rolling spool: Experiments and theory from mechanics to phase transitions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264161700_The_surprising_rolling_spool_Experiments_and_theory_from_mechanics_to_phase_transitions) with [PDF](../assets/physics/Surprising-EJP09JunRev.pdf)
			- For a single loop ‚û∞ and when it degenerates into just a (soliton) wave packet, its motion is the combination between the "propagation" in the direction of the the main thread and the "curling in & out" of the loop/packet.
			- In general, there are 3 parts of this movement: thread input, rotating inside, and thread output.
				- In Unithread view, all [bodies](((66c810a0-9861-4787-bdcf-1378219332be))) in the worlds, from celestial bodies, organisms (thread = food & info), to simple physical objects (thread = energy), are "living" (existing) by this movement. The difference is just how complicated the "rotation" inside that body is.
				- I think ‚Äú**transcycling** = cycling + translation‚Äù should be an apt term for this general movement.
					- ‚Äútranscycling = cycling + exchange (I/O)‚Äù: the bicycle cycling, itself, includes the translation of the bicycle and the exchange of momentum, but i add the prefix ‚Äútrans‚Äù to stress the intrinsic exchange of content, transition of state, transformation of thread.
					- Verb ‚Äúto transcycle‚Äù: When an obop transcycles *on/along* the thread from left to right, it transcycles the thread through its body and effectively makes the thread move from right to left relative to the obop.
					  id:: 67a963d2-c9b5-47e0-9b4d-9d6323a76c28
						- Intransitive verb: ‚Äúto transcycle on somebody‚Äù ~ ‚Äúto cycle on road‚Äù ~ ‚Äúto traverse some place‚Äù
						- Transitive verb: ‚Äúto transcycle something‚Äù ~ ‚Äúto recycle something‚Äù
							- Passive voice: ‚Äúsomething is transcycled through somebody‚Äù ~ ‚Äúsomething is cycled through somebody‚Äù ~ ‚Äúsomebody cycles through something's contents‚Äù (e.g. ‚ÄúThe Earth climate cycles through the warm El Ni√±o phase, the neutral phase and the cool La Ni√±a phase.‚Äù )
				- ‚Äútranscycling‚Äù is close to ‚Äútraversal‚Äù, with ‚Äúcycle‚Äù ~ ‚Äúverse = turn‚Äù!
					- ((678b72d3-073a-4763-a49f-5233a3d86614))
					- The ‚Äúturn‚Äù in ‚Äútraversal‚Äù is the change (nearly reverse) of direction in the zigzag course or switchback: to exhaustively traverse a flat space, we must switchback many times.
						- A milder ‚Äúturn‚Äù is the ‚Äúturn away‚Äù (nearly perpendicularly) from the main direction of the flow/river/road to **cross over** it, i.e. the original meaning of the Latin verb ‚Äú[traversare](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/traversare)‚Äù.
					- ‚Äúturn‚Äù ~ ‚Äúrotate‚Äù: in maths, ‚Äúturn = cycle‚Äù like ‚Äú[turn of rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(knot)) = round loop of rope‚Äù, ‚Äú[1 turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle)) = 1 cycle‚Äù 1œÑ = 2œÄ
