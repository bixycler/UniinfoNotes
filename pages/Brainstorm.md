					- the [exterior derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative) $dω$ captures the source of the flow.
					- the differential form $ω$ captures the flow on/through the boundary $∂Ω$ of the orientable manifold $Ω$.
				- circular flow: source $dω$ = curl $∇×F$ of vector field $F$
					- flow on $∂Ω$: in 1D, it's a simple 1-form $ω_1 = \mathbf{F}⋅d\mathbf{r} = F_x dx + F_y dy + F_z dz$
						- in higher dimensions, the ($n-1$)-form is difficult to formulate, 
						  e.g. $ω_2 = (F_y - F_x)dx∧dy  + (F_z - F_y)dy∧dz + (F_x - F_z)dz∧dx$
				- diverging flow: source $dω$ = divergence $∇⋅F$ of vector field $F$
					- flow through $∂Ω$ is an ($n-1$)-form which is Hodge dual of the 1-form, 
					  e.g. $ω_{3-1} = ⋆ω_1 = ⋆(\mathbf{F}⋅d\mathbf{r}) = \mathbf{F}⋅(⋆d\mathbf{r}) = F_x⋅ dy∧dz + F_y⋅ dz∧dx + F_z⋅ dx∧dy$
				- [Green's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem#Relationship_to_the_divergence_theorem) beautifully captures both curl and divergence by simply turning the basis a right angle: $(dx, dy)$ for curl → $(dy, -dx)$ for divergence.
				- When $Ω$ is 1D, i.e. a line segment, this becomes the fundamental theorem of calculus: 
				  $\int_{a}^b{df} = \int_{a,b}{f} = f(b) - f(a)$

						- That means $DP_D$ is the deviation of $ABCD$ from the parallelogram $ABCP_D$.
					- When $M, N$ are midpoints of the two diagonals $AC, BD$, then $DP_D = 2MN$, and we have another formula:

			- **Convergence for Explosion**: The closing isn’t just a negative end (death, decline); it’s a convergence of conditions, like a sunset or a black hole collapsing externally, that sets the stage for an "explosion" of opportunity, like a sunrise or a white hole opening internally, a preparation for new beginnings (reborn, germination).
			- **Transformative Technique**: This flip can be applied as a mindset—viewing a "closing" (e.g., a failure or end) not as a negative end but as a convergence point that prepares for a new "opening" (e.g., a fresh start or opportunity).

			- Argument(s) of a function is/are the one(s) determining the result value of the function.
				- A logical statement is just a Boolean function $P: X → \{⊤, ⊥\}$ where $x ∈ X$ is the argument.

			- Argument of complex number $φ = \arg(z)$ is the one determining the complexity of the number.
				- $z = r⋅\exp(i⋅φ) = r⋅e^{i⋅φ}$: beside constants $i, e$ and pararmeter $r$, the **argument** $φ$ is the one that determines how much “complex” $z$ is by the angular distance from the real axis.
				- Because the modulus $r$ is already the normal (real) number, the phase $φ$ is the critical component for the complexity.

			- I'm discussing with Copilot, but the right image is blocked because it's "too sensitive!" 😯😧
			  collapsed:: true
				- Maybe it looks like a crotch 🤔?!
				- I just want to make it clear that the circle is a loop ➰, not separate from the thread.
			- Copilot suggests "spooling" & "entwining".
			  collapsed:: true
				- While "entwining" is good for its broad sense, "spooling" is good for its common usage in computing and capturing both "spooling in" and "spooling out".
				- For a thick coil with many loops in between, "spooling" is a great term which can be combined with "rolling": at the two ends, the thread is "spooled in/out", while in between, it just rolls/rotates around.
				- I'm thinking of the new term “spool-rolling” or “sprolling” /sprol.ɪŋ/ to combine “spooling” & “rolling”!
					- While “[rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling) = rotation + translation”, “sprolling = winding + translation”
					- The slang “[sproll](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sproll)” can be “spin + roll” or “spam + troll”.
					- Don't be confused with “sprawling” /sprɔːl.ɪŋ/
					- Related to the hot “rolling spool”.

			- For a single loop ➰ and when it degenerates into just a (soliton) wave packet, its motion is the combination between the "propagation" in the direction of the the main thread and the "curling in & out" of the loop/packet.
			- In general, there are 3 parts of this movement: thread input, rotating inside, and thread output.
				- In Unithread view, all [bodies](((66c810a0-9861-4787-bdcf-1378219332be))) in the worlds, from celestial bodies, organisms (thread = food & info), to simple physical objects (thread = energy), are "living" (existing) by this movement. The difference is just how complicated the "rotation" inside that body is.
				- I think “**transcycling** = cycling + translation” should be an apt term for this general movement.
					- “transcycling = cycling + exchange (I/O)”: the bicycle cycling, itself, includes the translation of the bicycle and the exchange of momentum, but i add the prefix “trans” to stress the intrinsic exchange of content, transition of state, transformation of thread.
					- Verb “to transcycle”: When an obop transcycles *on/along* the thread from left to right, it transcycles the thread through its body and effectively makes the thread move from right to left relative to the obop.

						- Intransitive verb: “to transcycle on somebody” ~ “to cycle on road” ~ “to traverse some place”
						- Transitive verb: “to transcycle something” ~ “to recycle something”
							- Passive voice: “something is transcycled through somebody” ~ “something is cycled through somebody” ~ “somebody cycles through something's contents” (e.g. “The Earth climate cycles through the warm El Niño phase, the neutral phase and the cool La Niña phase.” )
				- “transcycling” is close to “traversal”, with “cycle” ~ “verse = turn”!
					- ((678b72d3-073a-4763-a49f-5233a3d86614))
					- The “turn” in “traversal” is the change (nearly reverse) of direction in the zigzag course or switchback: to exhaustively traverse a flat space, we must switchback many times.
						- A milder “turn” is the “turn away” (nearly perpendicularly) from the main direction of the flow/river/road to **cross over** it, i.e. the original meaning of the Latin verb “[traversare](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/traversare)”.
					- “turn” ~ “rotate”: in maths, “turn = cycle” like “[turn of rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(knot)) = round loop of rope”, “[1 turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle)) = 1 cycle” 1τ = 2π

			- "pipe" over "tube, cylinder": the axis is indefinitely long and it's also used for signal/message conveyance.
			- Thread of N distributions of marks (via pipe wrapping of N subthreads) = N-dim function = function derivable in N levels (through pipe wrapping) to straight line = motion in N-dim space = N particles in 1D space
				- wrap up to N-dim box = SCIFER of N sustents
					- Acceleration via changing the order of sustents
				- N-level extension = linearization of N-dim curve to straight line, so that it can be piped through pipe wrapping
					- Thread linearization = digital serialization
				- 3rd law of Newton shown on relative distributions of 2 threads on the pipe
			- The same meaning/image form different roots:
			  “Both North & South poles are just two ends of the axis pole!”
				- "pole" & "whole"  from old English "pal" & "hal" 
				  vs
				- "pole" & "holo-" form Greek "polos" & "holos"!
				- Is there some relationship here?!
