		- Some established formalisms for the notion of “distribution of space” in Unithread
		  id:: 67bda37c-7085-4a71-b5bf-6c4b54b3abdd
		  collapsed:: true
			- Clarify confusions about the “distribution **of** space”:
				- “Distribution of space” is the configuration of the space itself, not the distribution of objects in that space, nor the [space of probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space).
					- Google Search AI as well as other chatbots think of “distribution _of_ space” as “distribution _in_ space”.
					  collapsed:: true
						- > The distribution of space is *the arrangement of objects or phenomena in a given area*. It can be used to describe the organization of people, buildings, or other features in a geographical space.
						- Features of spatial distribution
							- **Density**: How often something occurs in a space
							- **Concentration**: How spread out a feature is across a space
							- **Pattern**: The geometric arrangement of objects in a space
						- Examples of spatial distribution: Mapping of a city, the cosmic web
				- Due to the intrisic relativity, the objective space (physical space) is distributed in, usually ununiformly relative to, the subjective space represented by a coordinate system which is uniform (flat, straight) by definition.
					- In [spacetime distribution](((67c1273d-c336-4203-bc0d-68150f382c72))), the proper intervals in spacetime is compared to the intervals in coordinates of the observing subject.
				- Distribution is a generalization of mapping.
				- While mapping & function focuses on _individual points_, i.e. “point mapping”, distribution focuses on [**regions**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(mathematical_analysis)), like in “neighbourhood topology”, and corresponding measures of these regions like total amount ($D^{-1}$), center or mean ($D^{0}$), density ($D^{1}$), curvature ($D^{2}$), etc., as well as the [tranforms](((669dd16c-1836-40ec-86e5-772f8f4774ce))) of these regions.
			- [Schwartz distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics)) $T$ with action $T[]$ on a test function $φ()$ projecting the whole test function into a number $T[φ]$, usually through integration.
				- The action $T[]$ uses the test function $φ()$ to collect the whole region of $φ$'s support into a number $T[φ]$ which measures the distribution in that region.
				- Example of distributions: Heaviside step function $H(x)$ --[distributional derivative]--> Dirac delta function $δ(x)$.
				- Distributional derivative: $T'[φ] = - T[φ']$
				  Action of derivative distribution $T'$ on test function $φ$ is the negative action of the original distribution $T$ on derivative of test function $φ'$.

				  $κ T_{μν} = (Λ - \frac{1}{2} R) g_{μν} + R_{μν}$
					- Tensors
						- $T_{μν}$: [stress–energy tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor) representing the distribution of matter and energy
						- $g_{μν}$: [metric tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor_(general_relativity)) defining the geometric properties of spacetime, such as distances, angles, curvatures, etc.
						- $R_{μν},\,R$: [Ricci curvature tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricci_curvature) and [Ricci scalar curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_curvature) derived from the metric tensor $g_{μν}$ in a complicated manner
							- Ricci curvatures (tensor & scalar) are contractions of [Riemann curvature tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_curvature_tensor):
							  $R_{μν} = g^{ab} R_{aμbν} \;;\; R = g^{μν} R_{μν} = 2 K = 2 κ_1 κ_2$
							- $K$: [Gaussian curvature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature)
							- $κ_1,\, κ_2$: [principal curvatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_curvature)
					- Constants
					  collapsed:: true
						- $κ = (8πG)/c^4 ≈ 2.07665 × 10^{-43}\,{\textrm N}^{-1}$: Einstein gravitational constant
						- $G$: gravitational constant
						- $c$: speed of light
						- $Λ$: [cosmological constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant)
				- The Einstein field equation is so complicated with all kinds of tensors and curvatures! 🫤
				  id:: 67bdb94a-e172-43f9-a59e-a97756fef1f4
				- Einstein use curvature to refer to spacetime warping because it's crutial in General Relativity: [curvature = force](((67b5c77d-c42c-4dc5-8d47-fd82f535177a))) in [equivalence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle) and various curvatures in ((67bdaa5e-66c0-4874-8ca6-95032208e06d)).
				- However, the spacetime distribution represented by its density is much more intuitive and more fundamental, which is defined directly by the metric tensor $g_{μν}$ as the ((669a58b9-eb34-41cd-8605-02e29b07e1b5)) of spacetime.

					- Spacetime distortion of proper spacetime when projected onto a flat Cartesian coordinate system:
					  id:: 67c1273d-c336-4203-bc0d-68150f382c72
						- *Compression/Contraction*: Proper distance/interval at the herenow is greater than the coordinate distance/interval observed by an external observer.
						- *Stretch/Dilation*: Proper distance/interval at the herenow is less than the coordinate distance/interval observed by an external observer.
					- Spacetime distribution around a massive object, like the Sun 🌞, as shown in [Schwarzschild metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric)
						- Spacetime interval ($ds$) and proper time interval ($dτ$) in spherical coordinates $(t, r, θ, φ)$ with signature convention (+, -, -, -)
						  $${ds}^2 = c^2 {dτ}^2 \;=\; ( 1 - \frac{R_s}{r} )c^2 {dt}^2 \; - ( 1 - \frac{R_s}{r} )^{-1} dr^2 \; - r^2 {dΩ}^2$$
						  with ${dΩ}^2 = ({dθ}^2 + (\sin θ)^2 {dφ}^2)$ and [Schwarzschild radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius) $R_s = {2GM}/{c^2}$
						- **Stretch/dilation** of time: The coefficient $(1 - R_s/r)$ of  ${dt}^2$ is large near the Sun. This means that proper time intervals are shorter than coordinate time intervals.
						- **Compression/contraction** of radial distances: The coefficient $(1 - R_s/r)^{-1}$ of ${dr}^2$ is small near the Sun. This means that proper radial distances are greater than coordinate radial distances.
				- So, the balance way should be using both: distribution for introductory level and curvatures for adavanced level.
				  collapsed:: true
					- By using both distribution and curvature, students can develop a deeper understanding of general relativity and its underlying principles.
					- The Benefits of Distribution
						- *Easier visualization*: Distribution is a more tangible concept, allowing students to visualize how spacetime changes around massive objects.
						- *Simpler language*: Describing spacetime in terms of distribution avoids the complexities of curvature, making it easier for students to grasp.
						- *More relatable*: Distribution is a concept that can be related to everyday experiences, such as stretching or compressing materials.
					- The Role of Curvature
						- [Curvature = force](((67b5c77d-c42c-4dc5-8d47-fd82f535177a))) in [equivalence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle)

			- Copilot suggests "spooling" & "entwining".
			  collapsed:: true
				- While "entwining" is good for its broad sense, "spooling" is good for its common usage in computing and capturing both "spooling in" and "spooling out".
				- For a thick coil with many loops in between, "spooling" is a great term which can be combined with "rolling": at the two ends, the thread is "spooled in/out", while in between, it just rolls/rotates around.
				- I'm thinking of the new term “spool-rolling” or “sprolling” /sprol.ɪŋ/ to combine “spooling” & “rolling”!
					- While “[rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling) = rotation + translation”, “sprolling = winding + translation”
					- The slang “[sproll](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sproll)” can be “spin + roll” or “spam + troll”.
					- Don't be confused with “sprawling” /sprɔːl.ɪŋ/
					- Related to the hot “rolling spool”.

			- For a single loop ➰ and when it degenerates into just a (soliton) wave packet, its motion is the combination between the "propagation" in the direction of the the main thread and the "curling in & out" of the loop/packet.
			- In general, there are 3 parts of this movement: thread input, rotating inside, and thread output.
				- In Unithread view, all [bodies](((66c810a0-9861-4787-bdcf-1378219332be))) in the worlds, from celestial bodies, organisms (thread = food & info), to simple physical objects (thread = energy), are "living" (existing) by this movement. The difference is just how complicated the "rotation" inside that body is.
				- I think “**transcycling** = cycling + translation” should be an apt term for this general movement.
					- “transcycling = cycling + exchange (I/O)”: the bicycle cycling, itself, includes the translation of the bicycle and the exchange of momentum, but i add the prefix “trans” to stress the intrinsic exchange of content, transition of state, transformation of thread.
					- Verb “to transcycle”: When an obop transcycles *on/along* the thread from left to right, it transcycles the thread through its body and effectively makes the thread move from right to left relative to the obop.

						- Intransitive verb: “to transcycle on somebody” ~ “to cycle on road” ~ “to traverse some place”
						- Transitive verb: “to transcycle something” ~ “to recycle something”
							- Passive voice: “something is transcycled through somebody” ~ “something is cycled through somebody” ~ “somebody cycles through something's contents” (e.g. “The Earth climate cycles through the warm El Niño phase, the neutral phase and the cool La Niña phase.” )
				- “transcycling” is close to “traversal”, with “cycle” ~ “verse = turn”!
					- ((678b72d3-073a-4763-a49f-5233a3d86614))
					- The “turn” in “traversal” is the change (nearly reverse) of direction in the zigzag course or switchback: to exhaustively traverse a flat space, we must switchback many times.
						- A milder “turn” is the “turn away” (nearly perpendicularly) from the main direction of the flow/river/road to **cross over** it, i.e. the original meaning of the Latin verb “[traversare](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/traversare)”.
					- “turn” ~ “rotate”: in maths, “turn = cycle” like “[turn of rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(knot)) = round loop of rope”, “[1 turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle)) = 1 cycle” 1τ = 2π
