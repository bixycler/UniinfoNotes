	- In possessive form like "Will's note", [the apostrophe `'` stands for](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/history-and-use-of-the-apostrophe) the "e" in the suffix "-es" of [genitive form](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/genitive) of noun in the [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English).

		  collapsed:: true
			- `Will/mind/conceptual/head` in file management =
			- `Will.mind.conceptual.head` in programming =
			- "Will' mind' conceptual' head" in natural language!
	- **Id < *address* < context**  
	  id:: 66600918-ed92-40c9-bda5-1911865d676c
	  collapsed:: true
	  All content arrow is via its complement context:   
	  full content = apparent content carried by the form + hidden content (context as form)
		- form = condensed context = condensed hidden content
		- optimization = formation = context condensation (to the extremes like id)
		  + optimization frees the subject from the lengthy "irrelevant" context, but also constrains to the form!
	- All objects are arrows, addresses, vector, `v`'s
	  collapsed:: true
		- Relativity: The destination of that address is relative to the root object (intent, self).
		- The root object `O` is just another vector, hence the target of `v` from `O` is just `O+v`.
		- `v` is the diff, the change, the transformation, the effect brought to `O`.
		- Intensionally, it's the addition `O+v`, but extensionally it's the multiplication `O⋅v`.
	- The relativity & equality between form & content as 2 vectors
	  collapsed:: true
		- `u⋅v = 0` means orthogonal... but their "self threads" are parallel!?!
		- The portion of seen is the portion of orthogonal => parallel = unseen
		- We see a static object, which is almost parallel to us in time, thanks to the near orthogonal light rays from it! That's why we can only see its external shape, i.e. very little part of it.
	- directory/folder = namespace (exclusive)

	  collapsed:: true
		- obj `Will` -> {in-world `Will/**`, ex-world `Will\*/*`} = {M, W} = {inner view cone, outer view cone}
		- Will's in-world contains properties of `Will`, like `Will/name`, `Will/age`, `Will/mind`, `Will/mind/conceptual`, `Will/mind/conceptual/{dog,mouse}`, etc.
		- Will's ex-world contains `Will` and other peers of `Will`, like `Na`, `Nyatty`, `Earth`, `Milky Way`, etc.
		  id:: 66600918-71e0-4cad-b37d-6ceacd7df5eb
		  collapsed:: true
			- In the top-down view, Will's ex-world can be partitioned by region, e.g. `Vietnam/house of Will/Na` vs `Japan/house of Harusada/Na`. But we use the ***relative*** (bottom-up) view from Will: `Will\1/Na` is just the dog Na closest to Will, i.e. `Will\1/Na` = `Will\2/house of Will/Na` = `Vietnam/house of Will/Na`.
			- The backslash is used in [MS-DOS/Windows' path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#MS-DOS/Microsoft_Windows_style), in [PHP namespace](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php), and as [Decimal Exponent Symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation "Scientific notation") in [ALGOL 68](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_68 "ALGOL 68"). Our use of `\u` as "u-level container" is nearest to the use in ALGOL 68.

	  id:: 66669d80-3648-415c-b426-e8105cf6ef80
	  collapsed:: true
		- The part of content that "i don't care" (body) is abstracted, the remaining brief is called "head", "name", "key", etc. That head is further shortened [from the lengthy context to address, to name and to id](((66600918-ed92-40c9-bda5-1911865d676c))).
		- Now, in the view of the subject, that part is just a name, a symbol, a ref, a form, which can further be renamed, transformed into different forms to fit subjective views. E.g. the local name, local variable is the transformed name of the address.
		- In the subjective view, a concise name can be expanded into the content of the named object via many forms of embedding: (parenthesis), clauses like `which`, `where`, etc.
		- The name is the link between the named ((667cfa42-ade7-4310-9a7b-6d14d01c16da)) and the name using ((667cfa3e-9856-43f0-956b-ebb4ff31d8eb)).
			- In ((667cfa42-ade7-4310-9a7b-6d14d01c16da))'s side, the name is its abstraction.
			- In ((667cfa3e-9856-43f0-956b-ebb4ff31d8eb))'s side, the name is a part of the subject's content.
			- Hence, the name is an interface of the ((667cfa42-ade7-4310-9a7b-6d14d01c16da)) for the ((667cfa3e-9856-43f0-956b-ebb4ff31d8eb)) to use.
			- Thanks to its conciseness, the name can be used by many subjects. This use is the [mixing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_(physics)) of content between objects.

			- With [the abstraction of body and extraction of head](((66669d80-3648-415c-b426-e8105cf6ef80))), a circle can refer to its sub-circles using heads of sub-circles.

				- Words in the context can be either other sub-circles' heads, i.e. keywords, or global non-key words (prepositions) whose content is not closed in a concrete circle but open to the collection of all contexts using them.
				- These prepositions can have descriptions, or even definitions, but their true definition is the whole extension of contexts using them. That means a preposition can only be "understood" but cannot be transcluded (embedded, expanded, unfolded).
					- These prepositions are "atoms" of the system, when the whole system is expanded/unfolded, the "raw thread" is nothing but a chain of prepositions, as component arrows.
