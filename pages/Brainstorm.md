			- Similar to the [Liar Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox), the _negation program_ is so ‚Äúpathological‚Äù that no ‚Äúhalting doctor‚Äù can detect if it will halt xor not.
			- **Simple Halting Proposition** ($\text{HP0}$): There exists a decider $H()$ such that for all program $p$, $H(p)$ decides whether $p$ halts xor not.
				- $\text{HP0} := ‚àÉ H, ‚àÄ p: [(H(p) = ‚ä§) ‚äï (H(p) = ‚ä•)]$
			- **Simple Halting Problem**: $\text{HP0} = ?$
				- **Solution** (in classical logic): $\text{HP0} = ‚ä•$
				- **Proof by contradiction** (in classical logic):
					- **Assumption** $A$: $\text{HP0} = ‚ä§$, i.e. we have a decider $H_0$ as a program which can decide whether any program $p$ halts xor not.
						- $‚àÄ p: [(H_0(p) = ‚ä§) ‚äï (H_0(p) = ‚ä•)]$  [$A_1$]
					- We construct a _negation program_ $n_{H0}$ based on the decider $H_0$ given by assumption $A$:
						- ```python
						  n_H0: if H_0(n_H0) then loop_forever; else halt;
						  loop_forever: while True do continue;
						  ```
					- Consider 2 cases of result given by $H_0(n_{H0})$:
						- $H_0(n_{H0}) = ‚ä§ ‚áí H_0(n_{H0}) = H_0( \text{loop\_forever} ) = ‚ä•$
						- $H_0(n_{H0}) = ‚ä• ‚áí H_0(n_{H0}) = H_0(\text{halt}) = ‚ä§$
					- ‚áí $(H_0(n_{H0}) = ‚ä§) ‚Üî (H_0(n_{H0}) = ‚ä•)$
					- **Contradictions**:
						- ‚áí $[H_0(n_{H0}) = ‚ä§ ‚äï H_0(n_{H0}) = ‚ä•] = ‚ä•$, i.e. $H_0$ cannot decide $n_{H0}$, effectively negating $A_1$
					- **Conclusion** (by classical logic): Assumption $A$ is false, i.e. $\text{HP0} = ‚ä•$
			- In order to have a stronger conclusion by directly proving the negation of Halting Proposition **for all halting decider** $H$, without using proof by constradiction, 
			  i.e., $‚àÄ H, ‚àÉ p:  ¬¨[H(p) = ‚ä§ ‚äï H(p) = ‚ä•]$,
			  we must rephrase the Halting Proposition to be more general where program $p$ receives input $x$.
			- **Halting Proposition** ($\text{HP}$): There exists a decider $H(¬∑,¬∑)$ such that for all program $p(¬∑)$ and input $x$, $H(p, x)$ decides whether $p$ halts on $x$ xor not.
				- $\text{HP} := ‚àÉ H(¬∑,¬∑), ‚àÄ p(¬∑), ‚àÄ x: [(H(p,x) = ‚ä§) ‚äï (H(p,x) = ‚ä•)]$
			- **Halting Problem**: $\text{HP} = ?$
				- **Resolution**: $[(\text{HP} = ‚ä§) ‚äï (\text{HP} = ‚ä•)] = ‚ä•$, i.e. $\text{HP}$ is [undecidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem)
					- ‚áî $[(\text{HP} = ‚ä§) ‚Üî (\text{HP} = ‚ä•)]  = ‚ä§$
					- ‚áî $\text{HP} = ‚ä§‚Üî‚ä•  = 0 =$ [U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic) $=$ (in classical logic) $‚ä•$
				- **Direct Proof** of the classical solution $\text{HP} = ‚ä•$:
				  id:: 6f24d15c-4e73-4c0b-b43a-99b3ba2be1e2
					- We construct a _negation program_ $n_H$ receiving **any halting decider** $H$ as its input:
						- ```python
						  n_H(H): if H(n_H, H) then loop_forever; else halt;
						  loop_forever: while True do continue;
						  ```
					- Consider 2 cases of result given by $H(n_H, H)$:
						- $H(n_H, H) = ‚ä§ ‚áí H(n_H, H) = H( \text{loop\_forever}, ‚àÖ) = ‚ä•$
						- $H(n_H, H) = ‚ä• ‚áí H(n_H, H) = H(\text{halt}, ‚àÖ) = ‚ä§$
					- ‚áí $(H(n_H, H) = ‚ä§) ‚Üî (H(n_H, H) = ‚ä•)$
					- ‚áí $[(H(n_H, H) = ‚ä§) ‚äï (H(n_H, H) = ‚ä•)] = ‚ä•$
					- **Conclusion**: $‚àÄ H, ‚àÉ p = n_H, ‚àÉ x = H:  ¬¨[H(p, x) = ‚ä§ ‚äï H(p, x) = ‚ä•]$, i.e. $\text{HP} = ‚ä•$
				- **Proof by [diagonal argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument)**
					- Instead of considering any _halting_ decider, we show that any algorithmic decider $D$ in general cannot decide the halting property of the _negation program_ $n_H$.
					- We construct a _negation program_ $n_H$ receiving **any algorithmic decider** $D$ as its input:
						- ```python
						  n_H(D): if D(n_H, D) then loop_forever; else halt;
						  loop_forever: while True do continue;
						  ```
					- Let's define $H(¬∑,¬∑)$ as a (hypothetical) function determining the halting status of any program $p$ on input $x$.
					  id:: cd8323ea-6bcb-41d4-b9b9-fca9ef85bc5a
					- The result of $H(n_H, D)$ corresponding to $D(n_H, D)$:
						- $D(n_H, D) = ‚ä§ ‚áí H(n_H, D) = H( \text{loop\_forever}, ‚àÖ) = ‚ä• ‚â† D(n_H, D)$
						- $D(n_H, D) = ‚ä• ‚áí H(n_H, D) = H(\text{halt}, ‚àÖ) = ‚ä§ ‚â† D(n_H, D)$
					- ‚áí $D ‚â† H$
					- **Conclusion**: $‚àÄ D, ‚àÉ p = n_H, ‚àÉ x = D:  [D(p, x) ‚â† H(p, x)]$, i.e. the (hypothetical) halting determining function $H$ is not an algorithmic decider.
						- This indirectly negate the $\text{HP}$.
						- This is indirect proof is weaker than the [direct proof](((6f24d15c-4e73-4c0b-b43a-99b3ba2be1e2))) in the sense that it denies only the the _algorithm_, i.e. the execution, not the definition of $H$.
						- That means, $H$ can somehow determine the halting status of $n_H(D)$
			- ‚áí $\{ ‚àÄ H, ‚àÉ p = p_H:  ¬¨[H(p) = ‚ä§ ‚äï H(p) = ‚ä•] \} = ¬¨\text{HP0} = ‚ä§$
				- ‚áí $\text{HP0} = ‚ä•$, effectively negating $A$
				- **Anti-assumption** $¬¨A$: $\text{HP0} = ‚ä•$, i.e.
				- **Conclusion**:  $(\text{HP0} = ‚ä§) ‚Üî (\text{HP0} = ‚ä•)$, i.e. $\text{HP0}$ is undecidable

			- Copilot suggests "spooling" & "entwining".
			  collapsed:: true
				- While "entwining" is good for its broad sense, "spooling" is good for its common usage in computing and capturing both "spooling in" and "spooling out".
				- For a thick coil with many loops in between, "spooling" is a great term which can be combined with "rolling": at the two ends, the thread is "spooled in/out", while in between, it just rolls/rotates around.
				- I'm thinking of the new term ‚Äúspool-rolling‚Äù or ‚Äúsprolling‚Äù /sprol.…™≈ã/ to combine ‚Äúspooling‚Äù & ‚Äúrolling‚Äù!
					- While ‚Äú[rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling) = rotation + translation‚Äù, ‚Äúsprolling = winding + translation‚Äù
					- The slang ‚Äú[sproll](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sproll)‚Äù can be ‚Äúspin + roll‚Äù or ‚Äúspam + troll‚Äù.
					- Don't be confused with ‚Äúsprawling‚Äù /spr…îÀêl.…™≈ã/
					- Related to the hot ‚Äúrolling spool‚Äù.

			- For a single loop ‚û∞ and when it degenerates into just a (soliton) wave packet, its motion is the combination between the "propagation" in the direction of the the main thread and the "curling in & out" of the loop/packet.
			- In general, there are 3 parts of this movement: thread input, rotating inside, and thread output.
				- In Unithread view, all [bodies](((66c810a0-9861-4787-bdcf-1378219332be))) in the worlds, from celestial bodies, organisms (thread = food & info), to simple physical objects (thread = energy), are "living" (existing) by this movement. The difference is just how complicated the "rotation" inside that body is.
				- I think ‚Äú**transcycling** = cycling + translation‚Äù should be an apt term for this general movement.
					- ‚Äútranscycling = cycling + exchange (I/O)‚Äù: the bicycle cycling, itself, includes the translation of the bicycle and the exchange of momentum, but i add the prefix ‚Äútrans‚Äù to stress the intrinsic exchange of content, transition of state, transformation of thread.
					- Verb ‚Äúto transcycle‚Äù: When an obop transcycles *on/along* the thread from left to right, it transcycles the thread through its body and effectively makes the thread move from right to left relative to the obop.

						- Transitive verb: ‚Äúto transcycle something‚Äù ~ ‚Äúto recycle something‚Äù
							- Passive voice: ‚Äúsomething is transcycled through somebody‚Äù ~ ‚Äúsomething is cycled through somebody‚Äù ~ ‚Äúsomebody cycles through something's contents‚Äù (e.g. ‚ÄúThe Earth climate cycles through the warm El Ni√±o phase, the neutral phase and the cool La Ni√±a phase.‚Äù )
				- ‚Äútranscycling‚Äù is close to ‚Äútraversal‚Äù, with ‚Äúcycle‚Äù ~ ‚Äúverse = turn‚Äù!
					- ((678b72d3-073a-4763-a49f-5233a3d86614))
					- The ‚Äúturn‚Äù in ‚Äútraversal‚Äù is the change (nearly reverse) of direction in the zigzag course or switchback: to exhaustively traverse a flat space, we must switchback many times.
						- A milder ‚Äúturn‚Äù is the ‚Äúturn away‚Äù (nearly perpendicularly) from the main direction of the flow/river/road to **cross over** it, i.e. the original meaning of the Latin verb ‚Äú[traversare](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/traversare)‚Äù.
					- ‚Äúturn‚Äù ~ ‚Äúrotate‚Äù: in maths, ‚Äúturn = cycle‚Äù like ‚Äú[turn of rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(knot)) = round loop of rope‚Äù, ‚Äú[1 turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle)) = 1 cycle‚Äù 1œÑ = 2œÄ
