	- ((6651ecba-793d-43c5-8020-a9f260b032d8)) This is the ((665c92d1-565b-4911-a706-b32af429c3aa)) place for ((66536578-c4d3-43f1-b35c-bf71120f0570)).
	-
	- In possessive form like "Will's note", [the apostrophe `'` stands for](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/history-and-use-of-the-apostrophe) the "e" in the suffix "-es" of [genitive form](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/genitive) of noun in the [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English).
	  id:: 66536ad3-264b-4351-868b-e7e8a7a82774
	  collapsed:: true
		- Now I propose to use apostrophe to further omit the "s" in possessive form, so 
		  collapsed:: true
			- `Will/mind/conceptual/head` in file management =
			- `Will.mind.conceptual.head` in programming =
			- "Will' mind' conceptual' head" in natural language!
	- **Id < *address* < context**  
	  id:: 66600918-ed92-40c9-bda5-1911865d676c
	  collapsed:: true
	  All content arrow is via its complement context:   
	  full content = apparent content carried by the form + hidden content (context as form)
		- form = condensed context = condensed hidden content
		- optimization = formation = context condensation (to the extremes like id)
		  + optimization frees the subject from the lengthy "irrelevant" context, but also constrains to the form!
	- All objects are arrows, addresses, vector, `v`'s
	  collapsed:: true
		- Relativity: The destination of that address is relative to the root object (intent, self).
		- The root object `O` is just another vector, hence the target of `v` from `O` is just `O+v`.
		- `v` is the diff, the change, the transformation, the effect brought to `O`.
		- Intensionally, it's the addition `O+v`, but extensionally it's the multiplication `O⋅v`.
	- The relativity & equality between form & content as 2 vectors
	  collapsed:: true
		- `u⋅v = 0` means orthogonal... but their "self threads" are parallel!?!
		- The portion of seen is the portion of orthogonal => parallel = unseen
		- We see a static object, which is almost parallel to us in time, thanks to the near orthogonal light rays from it! That's why we can only see its external shape, i.e. very little part of it.
	- directory/folder = namespace (exclusive)
	  id:: 6651ade9-43c6-4beb-9981-cb03d53dc23c
	  collapsed:: true
		- obj `Will` -> {in-world `Will/**`, ex-world `Will\*/*`} = {M, W} = {inner view cone, outer view cone}
		- Will's in-world contains properties of `Will`, like `Will/name`, `Will/age`, `Will/mind`, `Will/mind/conceptual`, `Will/mind/conceptual/{dog,mouse}`, etc.
		- Will's ex-world contains `Will` and other peers of `Will`, like `Na`, `Nyatty`, `Earth`, `Milky Way`, etc.
		  id:: 66600918-71e0-4cad-b37d-6ceacd7df5eb
		  collapsed:: true
			- In the top-down view, Will's ex-world can be partitioned by region, e.g. `Vietnam/house of Will/Na` vs `Japan/house of Harusada/Na`. But we use the ***relative*** (bottom-up) view from Will: `Will\1/Na` is just the dog Na closest to Will, i.e. `Will\1/Na` = `Will\2/house of Will/Na` = `Vietnam/house of Will/Na`.
			- The backslash is used in [MS-DOS/Windows' path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#MS-DOS/Microsoft_Windows_style), in [PHP namespace](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php), and as [Decimal Exponent Symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation "Scientific notation") in [ALGOL 68](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_68 "ALGOL 68"). Our use of `\u` as "u-level container" is nearest to the use in ALGOL 68.
		- Other notations of path:
		  collapsed:: true
			- `Will/mind/conceptual/dog`, `Will\1/Na` in file management
			- `Will.mind.conceptual.dog`, `Will^1.Na` in programming
			- "Will' mind' conceptual' dog", "Will^1' Na" in [natural language](((66536ad3-264b-4351-868b-e7e8a7a82774)))
		- Relation ref/arrow between objects in these worlds:
		  collapsed:: true
			- example: in -> ex: dog -> {Na, Nau}, mouse -> {Nyatty, Nyatto}
			- property composition: ex -> in: Na -> {dog, horse, monkey}
			- ((6651ecba-793d-43c5-8020-a9f260b032d8)) in -> in: dog -> {vocal: bark, genus: Canis}
			- extension/reference: in -> ex.in: `Will/mind/conceptual/dog` -> `Wikipedia/Dog`
			- relation: ex -> ex: Na -> {child: Nau, prey: Nyatty}
			-
	- `in` + `ex` = `con`
	  id:: 66600918-bbc8-4d92-8d46-dbda3eed92f0
	  collapsed:: true
		- form + partial content = intent + extent = full content (Ω)
		- id, key := value
		  collapsed:: true
			- id : type { type = {id : `*`} }
		- in-thread touches ex-thread
		  collapsed:: true
			- function ex = f(in)
			- variation of ex compared to in
			- in + ex unified to Ω thread (full content)  
			  -> in = form = abstraction of Ω
			- in reflects ex with distortions: abstraction, mixing
		- recursive bifurcation via recursive reflection:  
		  $e_0 = i_0 = c = con = ex + in = e_1 + i_1 = e_1 + (e_2 + i_2) =$  
		  $e_1 + (e_2 + (e_3 + (... i_n)))$
	- Convert all metadata to block-links
	  collapsed:: true
		- `#tag` = block-link
		  id:: 66faa5f8-4513-41d9-97af-65bfab4d13f1
		- `property.subprop: some string value` is stored as an item with property `name` like this:
		  collapsed:: true
			- some string value 
			  name:: ((6651ea73-78b4-4c1a-b052-b2ea9555b6f6))
			  :LOGBOOK:

		- We can define property with composite value like this:
		  collapsed:: true
			- a composite
			  name:: ((6652048c-27b3-47b6-84e5-25af8d9ce801))
			  collapsed:: true
				- a component
				- another component
		- Store properties in sub-items:
		  It's simpler just to use sub-items to store properties. Then in the property `components` of the container item, we can collect forms (definitions) of these sub-item-properties into a list, like this:
		  components:: ((66532914-003a-4bbb-9e97-6f1c87170d7d)), ((66532bc2-a18e-43ab-86ac-a0f0f7dcbbb5))
		  collapsed:: true
			- ((6651ecba-793d-43c5-8020-a9f260b032d8)) This is an example of how to use sub-items as properties.
			- ((6652048c-27b3-47b6-84e5-25af8d9ce801)) This component contains sub-components:
			  collapsed:: true
				- a component
				- another component

		- Now, in the view of the subject, that part is just a name, a symbol, a ref, a form, which can further be renamed, transformed into different forms to fit subjective views. E.g. the local name, local variable is the transformed name of the address.
		- In the subjective view, a concise name can be expanded into the content of the named object via many forms of embedding: (parenthesis), clauses like `which`, `where`, etc.
		- The name is the link between the named ((667cfa42-ade7-4310-9a7b-6d14d01c16da)) and the name using ((667cfa3e-9856-43f0-956b-ebb4ff31d8eb)).

					- These prepositions are "atoms" of the system, when the whole system is expanded/unfolded, the "raw thread" is nothing but a chain of prepositions, as component arrows.
		- In a tree system, the path from root to a blob, i.e. the chain of heads of circular blobs, is the path/address of that blob, and the collection of all addresses create a branch system, an address space, a view cone.

							  $$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty } {\sqrt n} B_d( \frac{x}{\sqrt n} + \frac{1}{2} ) = φ(x | μ=0, σ=\frac{1}{2}) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} e^{-2 x^2} $$

			- That main cause determines the result thanks to the choice of the self.

				- The self selects conditions to match that main cause.

		- accept (choiceless) vs intent (choice)
			- They are 2 opposite ends but are united in the circle of learning:
			  accept -> learn -> intent to follow that lesson of "acceptance is the best" -> acceptive attitude -> accept
			- I usually place my ((667272b8-88a8-4928-a22a-35035c9edf05)) at the "accept", so i see all of the chain of effects as "no choice". But that's just relative, because...
			- The choice at the "intent" does affect the acceptance and what will be learnt next.
				- This is in line with the ((6713acf0-2eb0-423b-ac61-6f595ea12b86)).

			- Dialogue
				- For quick notes, i just use the hyphen-minus `-` or item bullet point to switch person, double hyphen `--` for interruption, and triple hyphen `---` for source attribution.

		- Etymology
			- Seems that “into thin air” was [popularized by Shakespeare](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/into_thin_air#Etymology) first (1500s), then “out of thin air” came later (1830s) as an opposite.
			- idioms.online: [Meaning of Idiom ‘Out of Thin Air’](https://www.idioms.online/out-of-thin-air/)
			  > The antonym, into thin air, has been used since at least the 1500s. Out of thin air has been used since at least the 1830s.
			  > Thin air, in this idiom, refers to the air in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, a location that was mysterious and unknown at the time this idiom originated.

				  Our revels now are ended. These our actors,

				   Bear with my weakness. My old brain is troubled.
