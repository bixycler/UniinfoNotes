			- **Simple Halting Proposition** ($\text{HP0}$): There exists a decider $H()$ such that for all program $p$, $H(p)$ decides whether $p$ halts xor not.

			- **Simple Halting Problem**: $\text{HP0} = ?$
				- **Resolution**: $[(\text{HP0} = ⊤) ⊕ (\text{HP0} = ⊥)] = ⊥$, i.e. $\text{HP0}$ is [undecidable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem)

					- ⇔ $\text{HP0} = ⊤↔⊥  = 0 =$ [U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic) $=$ (in classical logic) $⊥$

						- ```python
						  p_H0: if H(p_H0) then loop_forever; else halt;
						  loop_forever: while True do continue;
						  ```
					- Consider 2 cases of $H(p_{H0})$:

						- $H(p_{H0}) = ⊥ ⇒ H(p_{H0}) = H(\text{halt}) = ⊤$

					- **Contradictions**:
						- ⇒ $[H(p_H) = ⊤ ⊕ H(p_H) = ⊥] = ⊥$, i.e. $H$ cannot decide $p_H$, effectively negating $A_1$
					- **Conclusion** (by classical logic): Assumption $A$ is false, i.e. $\text{HP0} = ⊥$
			- In order to have a stronger conclusion by directly proving the negation of Halting Proposition, without using proof by constradiction, 
			  i.e., $∀ H, ∃ p = p_H:  ¬[H(p) = ⊤ ⊕ H(p) = ⊥]$,
			  we must rephrase the Halting Proposition to be more general where program $p$ receives input $x$.
			- **Halting Proposition** ($\text{HP}$): There exists a decider $H(·,·)$ such that for all program $p(·)$ and input $x$, $H(p, x)$ decides whether $p$ halts on $x$ xor not.

			- The linkage is due to [stagger = dependent origination](((67b541c9-befb-46b8-b2ae-e6e251043153))) and the [mismatch between circles](((67b541cb-a5c9-4634-b5f7-080d367faa4c))).

			- All the three parts of ((67a98760-71fa-4033-9c42-f3025d632d04)), i.e. input, output, internal bridge/cycle, are continued by staggering.
				- Output: integral/accumulation form higher derivative to lower level = action = projection outward from potential to actual = actualization = extension (from empty to solid, from abstract to concrete)
				- Input: differentiation/derivation from lover to higher level = attraction = observation = learning
				- Bridge: innermost bridge between inward & outward flow = equal = driver = switcher/chooser = free will
					- Fineness of this bridge = 1/size of self = degree of freedom
			- Stretching out by time, that transcycling becomes a double cone of ((66725144-6bc9-4c9f-ba48-2cef02651e52)) ~ [wave equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation) ~ [effect circle](((674ff584-00e3-40d8-9b77-21e9dca899dd))).
				- View cone: spatial distribution → density → curvature
				- Obop point: curvature = force

			- I'm discussing with Copilot, but the right image is blocked because it's "too sensitive!" 😯😧
			  collapsed:: true
				- Maybe it looks like a crotch 🤔?!
				- I just want to make it clear that the circle is a loop ➰, not separate from the thread.
			- Copilot suggests "spooling" & "entwining".
			  collapsed:: true
				- While "entwining" is good for its broad sense, "spooling" is good for its common usage in computing and capturing both "spooling in" and "spooling out".
				- For a thick coil with many loops in between, "spooling" is a great term which can be combined with "rolling": at the two ends, the thread is "spooled in/out", while in between, it just rolls/rotates around.
				- I'm thinking of the new term “spool-rolling” or “sprolling” /sprol.ɪŋ/ to combine “spooling” & “rolling”!
					- While “[rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling) = rotation + translation”, “sprolling = winding + translation”
					- The slang “[sproll](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sproll)” can be “spin + roll” or “spam + troll”.
					- Don't be confused with “sprawling” /sprɔːl.ɪŋ/
					- Related to the hot “rolling spool”.
						- [Rolling and pulling](https://leancrew.com/all-this/2023/06/rolling-and-pulling/)
						- [The surprising rolling spool: Experiments and theory from mechanics to phase transitions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264161700_The_surprising_rolling_spool_Experiments_and_theory_from_mechanics_to_phase_transitions) with [PDF](../assets/physics/Surprising-EJP09JunRev.pdf)
			- For a single loop ➰ and when it degenerates into just a (soliton) wave packet, its motion is the combination between the "propagation" in the direction of the the main thread and the "curling in & out" of the loop/packet.
			- In general, there are 3 parts of this movement: thread input, rotating inside, and thread output.
				- In Unithread view, all [bodies](((66c810a0-9861-4787-bdcf-1378219332be))) in the worlds, from celestial bodies, organisms (thread = food & info), to simple physical objects (thread = energy), are "living" (existing) by this movement. The difference is just how complicated the "rotation" inside that body is.
				- I think “**transcycling** = cycling + translation” should be an apt term for this general movement.
					- “transcycling = cycling + exchange (I/O)”: the bicycle cycling, itself, includes the translation of the bicycle and the exchange of momentum, but i add the prefix “trans” to stress the intrinsic exchange of content, transition of state, transformation of thread.
					- Verb “to transcycle”: When an obop transcycles *on/along* the thread from left to right, it transcycles the thread through its body and effectively makes the thread move from right to left relative to the obop.
					  id:: 67a963d2-c9b5-47e0-9b4d-9d6323a76c28
						- Intransitive verb: “to transcycle on somebody” ~ “to cycle on road” ~ “to traverse some place”
						- Transitive verb: “to transcycle something” ~ “to recycle something”
							- Passive voice: “something is transcycled through somebody” ~ “something is cycled through somebody” ~ “somebody cycles through something's contents” (e.g. “The Earth climate cycles through the warm El Niño phase, the neutral phase and the cool La Niña phase.” )
				- “transcycling” is close to “traversal”, with “cycle” ~ “verse = turn”!
					- ((678b72d3-073a-4763-a49f-5233a3d86614))
					- The “turn” in “traversal” is the change (nearly reverse) of direction in the zigzag course or switchback: to exhaustively traverse a flat space, we must switchback many times.
						- A milder “turn” is the “turn away” (nearly perpendicularly) from the main direction of the flow/river/road to **cross over** it, i.e. the original meaning of the Latin verb “[traversare](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/traversare)”.
					- “turn” ~ “rotate”: in maths, “turn = cycle” like “[turn of rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(knot)) = round loop of rope”, “[1 turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle)) = 1 cycle” 1τ = 2π

			- "pipe" over "tube, cylinder": the axis is indefinitely long and it's also used for signal/message conveyance.
			- Thread of N distributions of marks (via pipe wrapping of N subthreads) = N-dim function = function derivable in N levels (through pipe wrapping) to straight line = motion in N-dim space = N particles in 1D space
				- wrap up to N-dim box = SCIFER of N sustents
					- Acceleration via changing the order of sustents
				- N-level extension = linearization of N-dim curve to straight line, so that it can be piped through pipe wrapping
					- Thread linearization = digital serialization
				- 3rd law of Newton shown on relative distributions of 2 threads on the pipe
			- The same meaning/image form different roots:
			  “Both North & South poles are just two ends of the axis pole!”
				- "pole" & "whole"  from old English "pal" & "hal" 
				  vs
				- "pole" & "holo-" form Greek "polos" & "holos"!
