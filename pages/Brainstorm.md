	- ((6651ecba-793d-43c5-8020-a9f260b032d8)) This is the ((665c92d1-565b-4911-a706-b32af429c3aa)) place for ((66536578-c4d3-43f1-b35c-bf71120f0570)).
	-
	- In possessive form like "Will's note", [the apostrophe `'` stands for](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/history-and-use-of-the-apostrophe) the "e" in the suffix "-es" of [genitive form](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/genitive) of noun in the [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English).
	  id:: 66536ad3-264b-4351-868b-e7e8a7a82774
	  collapsed:: true
		- Now I propose to use apostrophe to further omit the "s" in possessive form, so 
		  collapsed:: true
			- `Will/mind/conceptual/head` in file management =
			- `Will.mind.conceptual.head` in programming =
			- "Will' mind' conceptual' head" in natural language!
	- **Id < *address* < context**  
	  collapsed:: true
	  All content arrow is via its complement context:   
	  full content = apparent content carried by the form + hidden content (context as form)
		- form = condensed context = condensed hidden content
		- optimization = formation = context condensation (to the extremes like ðŸ†”)
		  + optimization frees the subject from the lengthy "irrelevant" context, but also constrains to the form!
	- All objects are arrows, addresses, vector, `v`'s
	  collapsed:: true
		- Relativity: The destination of that address is relative to the root object (intent, self).
		- The root object `O` is just another vector, hence the target of `v` from `O` is just `O+v`.
		- `v` is the diff, the change, the transformation, the effect brought to `O`.
		- Intensionally, it's the addition `O+v`, but extensionally it's the multiplication `Oâ‹…v`.
	- The relativity & equality between form & content as 2 vectors
	  collapsed:: true
		- `uâ‹…v = 0` means orthogonal... but their "self threads" are parallel!?!
		- The portion of seen is the portion of orthogonal => parallel = unseen
		- We see a static object, which is almost parallel to us in time, thanks to the near orthogonal light rays from it! That's why we can only see its external shape, i.e. very little part of it.
	- directory/folder = namespace (exclusive)
	  id:: 6651ade9-43c6-4beb-9981-cb03d53dc23c
	  collapsed:: true
		- obj `Will` -> {in-world `Will/**`, ex-world `Will\*/*`} = {M, W} = {inner view cone, outer view cone}
		- Will's in-world contains properties of `Will`, like `Will/name`, `Will/age`, `Will/mind`, `Will/mind/conceptual`, `Will/mind/conceptual/{dog,mouse}`, etc.
		- Will's ex-world contains `Will` and other peers of `Will`, like `Na`, `Nyatty`, `Earth`, `Milky Way`, etc.
		  collapsed:: true
			- In the top-down view, Will's ex-world can be partitioned by region, e.g. `Vietnam/house of Will/Na` vs `Japan/house of Harusada/Na`. But we use the ***relative*** (bottom-up) view from Will: `Will\1/Na` is just the dog Na closest to Will, i.e. `Will\1/Na` = `Will\2/house of Will/Na` = `Vietnam/house of Will/Na`.
			- The backslash is used in [MS-DOS/Windows' path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#MS-DOS/Microsoft_Windows_style), in [PHP namespace](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php), and asÂ [Decimal Exponent Symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation "Scientific notation") inÂ [ALGOL 68](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_68 "ALGOL 68"). Our use of `\u` as "u-level container" is nearest to the use in ALGOL 68.
		- Other notations of path:
		  collapsed:: true
			- `Will/mind/conceptual/dog`, `Will\1/Na` in file management
			- `Will.mind.conceptual.dog`, `Will^1.Na` in programming
			- "Will' mind' conceptual' dog", "Will^1' Na" in [natural language](((66536ad3-264b-4351-868b-e7e8a7a82774)))
		- Relation ref/arrow between objects in these worlds:
		  collapsed:: true
			- example: in -> ex: dog -> {Na, Nau}, mouse -> {Nyatty, Nyatto}
			- property composition: ex -> in: Na -> {dog, horse, monkey}
			- ((6651ecba-793d-43c5-8020-a9f260b032d8)) in -> in: dog -> {vocal: bark, genus: Canis}
			- extension/reference: in -> ex.in: `Will/mind/conceptual/dog` -> `Wikipedia/Dog`
			- relation: ex -> ex: Na -> {child: Nau, prey: Nyatty}

		- id, key := value

			- id : type { type = {id : `*`} }
		- in-thread touches ex-thread
		  collapsed:: true
			- function ex = f(in)

			- in + ex unified to Î© thread (full content)  
			  -> in = form = abstraction of Î©
			- in reflects ex with distortions: abstraction, mixing
		- recursive bifurcation via recursive reflection:

		  $e_1 + (e_2 + (e_3 + (... i_n)))$
	- Convert all metadata to block-links
	  collapsed:: true
		- `#tag` = block-link

		- We can define property with composite value like this:
		  collapsed:: true
			- a composite
			  name:: ((6652048c-27b3-47b6-84e5-25af8d9ce801))
			  collapsed:: true
				- a component
				- another component
		- Store properties in sub-items:
		  It's simpler just to use sub-items to store properties. Then in the property `components` of the container item, we can collect forms (definitions) of these sub-item-properties into a list, like this:
		  components:: ((66532914-003a-4bbb-9e97-6f1c87170d7d)), ((66532bc2-a18e-43ab-86ac-a0f0f7dcbbb5))
		  collapsed:: true
			- ((6651ecba-793d-43c5-8020-a9f260b032d8)) This is an example of how to use sub-items as properties.
			- ((6652048c-27b3-47b6-84e5-25af8d9ce801)) This component contains sub-components:
			  collapsed:: true
				- a component
				- another component

		- Complement of "relation as 2 way arrow" is "relation as common part between related objects"
