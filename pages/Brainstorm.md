			- First, plan the time of working hours.
				- A working day should start from official works instead of personal works.
					- This is a good strategy but difficult for me because the out-of-work thoughts from the last night will naturally continue in the morning, keeping me from focusing on other works.
					- So, let's try using breathwork and meditation to switch the flow of thought from personal to official works.
				- Previously, i designed a [⟪Back to Work!⟫ reminder](((67d2a63d-58de-4dbe-bbec-3ec8625737c7))) but ineffective.

			- Normally, people [trust a trustee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_(social_science)) with the _**presumption** that the trustee will act in ways that benefit the trustor_.

					- “I let you in. I **open** myself. I’m **willing to be affected** by you.”
					- The vulnerability and negativity are not for distrust but for the **completeness** of the trustor.

					- Essentially, we must trust because we are **finite** beings in an **uncertain** world.
						- We never have complete knowledge.
						- We never have full control.
						- We cannot verify everything ourselves.
					- Trust is **how we cross the gaps** between:
						- known and unknown,
						- self and other,
						- past and future,
						- present and absent.
					- If we didn’t trust *anything or anyone*, we couldn’t:
						- drink a glass of water (do you test it yourself each time?),
						- cross a bridge (do you inspect every beam?),
						- listen to a teacher, doctor, or friend,
						- fall asleep while others are still awake,
						- *love*.
					- So **trust is not optional** – it’s the glue of life.
						- It’s what the philosopher Annette Baier called *“the atmosphere of trust”* – like oxygen: unnoticed when present, suffocating when absent.

				  id:: 68a566be-4e50-41d5-9213-bfb80178bc18
					- **The trustor bears responsibility** for *choosing* to trust, for judging the risks, and for _accepting the **inherent vulnerability**_.
					- The **trustee** bears responsibility for *honouring* that trust, through care, integrity, and effort – but not for controlling every outcome.
					- **Self-responsibility** is the key to make the trust grounded, deep, and strong.
						- While normaly, the **half trust** is dependent on the trustee, cut off from the trustor’s own responsibility.
							- It’s like leaning on one leg and blaming the ground when you fall.
							- It's fragile – collapses when unmet expectations surface.
						- **Complete trust** contains both poles: the openness toward the trustee *and* the self-responsibility of the trustor. It’s whole, stable, and strong.
						- Actually, no one is responsible for your own life, but you yourself!
				- Nuance: Don't confuse this “complete trust” with the common “absolute trust”.
				  collapsed:: true
					- **Absolute trust**: Trust without limits, conditions, or doubt.
						- Absoluteness *usually* means **blind reliance**: the trustor yields all responsibility.
						- **Brittleness**: the trustor collapses if the trustee fails.
					- **Complete trust**: Trust that includes not only belief, reliance, but also self-responsibility.
						- **Core feature:** Wholeness, balance, self-contained openness.
						- **Resilience:** Not destroyed by betrayal, because the trustor doesn’t abandon self-responsibility.
					- While that usual “absolute trust” is still a false trust, 
					  the *truly absolute trust* is the **absolute complete trust**:
					  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
					  unconditional, independent from the trustee’s behavior
					  thanks to self-responsibility
					  #+END_QUOTE
						- We can rely fully because we're standing fully on our own feet.

				- #### Three Faces of Trust
					- A hand half-open, half-closed – 
					  offering yet withholding,
					  leaning forward, leaning back,
					  never whole, never still.
					  Suspicion clings like shadow,
					  and the bond breaks
					  at the touch of weight:
					  this fragile face – *half trust*.
					- Eyes shut against the dark,
					  a heart surrendered without seeing –
					  this is the dream of certainty.
					  Strong as stone on the surface,
					  hollow at the core,
					  it cracks when truth arrives,
					  for blindness cannot bear the light:
					  this rigid mask – *blind absolute trust*.
					- Roots deep in the earth,
					  bamboo sways with the storm.
					  Here trust stands clear-eyed,
					  responsibility carried within,
					  risk neither denied nor feared.
					  It bends, it holds, it breathes –
					  a faith unbroken, resilient and free:
					  this living heart – *absolute complete trust*.

					-
				- Names in Vietnamese
					- Half trust: niềm tin nửa vời (bán tín bán nghi)
					- Blind absolute trust: niềm tin tuyệt đối mù quáng
					- Absolute complete trust: niềm tin trọn vẹn tuyệt đối
			- Belief → trust → faith
				- **Belief**: **Holding** something to be **true**; intellectual **acceptance**, a judgment about reality.
				- **Trust**: Relationship and **reliability**: Reliance on someone/something with confidence
					- The confidence is usually a belief that _“it won’t let me down”_.
					- However, a [wholesome trust](((68a595fa-385c-49a7-820f-67aa9db632d5))) should be based on the confidence of the trustor about its own acceptance of reality, and about the completeness of the life built upon trust.
				- **Faith**: Deeper than belief, broader than trust. It mixes conviction, trust, commitment, usually with loyalty or devotion.
				- While English splits *belief / trust / faith* into separate roots, Vietnamese folds them back into **one root “tin”** (信), then fans it out with qualifiers (*niềm, lòng, đức, cậy, nhiệm, thác*).
					- **Belief**: “niềm **tin**” (plain cognitive assent)
					- **Trust**: “tin **cậy**” (personal), “tín **nhiệm**” (social), “tín **thác**” (entrustment)
						- **Tín thác** = *tín nhiệm* (confidence in) + *phó thác* (entrustment)
						  Strong match for English *trust*, especially in the sense of “placing oneself in the care of another”.

			- From [boredom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boredom), pleasure/food cloyedness, to romantic disillusionment and even career burnout, the jadedness of people has shown the duality of pleasure and displeasure as well as the hidden fantasy in everyone.
			- Expectations & imginative images are the key of jadedness.
				- Expectation as an imagination bubble
					- People pre-load experiences with an imagined flavour based on signs (appearance, reputation, first impression).
					- The early enjoyment is partly *self-generated fantasy*, not reality-based content.
				- Reality’s slow reveal
					- As the real texture of the thing emerges – the *actual* taste of the food, the *actual* rhythm of the work – it inevitably differs from the fantasy.
					- This difference erodes the imagined sweetness.
				- The emotional crash = jadedness
					- Once the imagined pleasure fades, people are left with a baseline reality they never truly connected to, so it feels flat or even unpleasant.
					- The “sweet imagination” being annihilated, leaving only the “bitter reality”, people feel jaded, bored, sated.
				- Liberation
					- By avoiding expectation, accepting reality, not clinging to the superficial forms, enjoying the deep content, refraining from imagination, we won't be jaded or sick of anything.
					- By avoiding expectation and refraining from imaginative projection, we will meet reality *as it is* from the start.

				- To break the order of control, we must stop and [turn the eye back](((68898917-e61f-4d23-9124-474efa9a9eee))) to the intents, turning the intents from the role of subject/agent to object.

						- The control is determined by the view => out of view = out of control.
					- The empty center has the highest order because there's nothing left behind to control. To the empty center, everything is object, no more agent.
				- Because the empty center has higher order than the circled center (with form, self),
				- we practice relying on the empty center, the selfless obop, to let the crystal form be in contact with the formless content, so that it can be transformed easily.
					- When a form collides with another form, it resists change by trying to preserve its own form.
					- But when a form touches the content, it absorbs naturally, hence changes effortlessly.
			- These practices are just skillful means that applies the truth into our own life.
				- Without these skillful means, the self will still be destructed, the form and order will still be changed, but will take longer time and more sufferings.

			- Thanks to its zero intent, the empty center = self-essence = Nibbāna = the non-self (Anattā) has infinite extent coverring everything, hence the great Self (Ātman).
			- The empty center is an **ideal obop**, an obop without self/intent, a “selfless obop”, i.e. the limit of obop when its intent approaches zero.
				- The emtpy self-essence is just a focal point, a ((66728236-5b19-425c-bb5f-dfc0dc8b79fd)), an abstraction, not a concrete self.
				- Being focused & projected from the ((669a5387-2a97-4311-a295-aa0afd9c4d76))s around, the visible self-essence (as an empty center) cannot exist on its own. In other words, the self-essence itself has no essence.
				- The “invisible self-essence”, usually called “Nibbāna”, is immanent in everything. In other words, everything has a self-essence which is empty. This immanence is because nothing can obstruct a thing with zero intent, thus the zero-intent Nibbāna permeates everything.
				- Though empty, the central role of the self-essence in the self makes it essential to every self.
					- All parts of the self-circle are integrated by focusing on the same center. Via that center, they all are one, seeing/feeling/treating each other as the same ((66c810a0-9861-4787-bdcf-1378219332be)) of self.
					- When a self-circle loses its center, it just ceases to exist as itself and disintegrates into smaller circles.
					- Such essence of the empty center is can be seen in the hub of the wheel.

				- In a ((6851578b-9b1f-4367-878f-79b0b0b9be51)) with multiple layers of self-circle,
					- each self-circle has an obop which is just another self-circle inside, and
					- the limit of this inward stepping is the self-essence, i.e. the apex of the double cone.
			- The formation of a self starts with the closure of its self-circle, i.e. ((66e40f4b-34ae-499a-8192-0a0f4f580c7e)), 
			  sustained by the conservation of its content, i.e. ((66e40f58-c9dd-47f4-999d-2e4a2aa874fe)), 
			  and stablized by the central obop so that it can crystallize into a round circle i.e. ((66e40f75-0573-484e-8cb6-b6b8071ffb8c)).
				- Even though the intial “seed” at the center is solid (a concrete obop), like the [ice nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_nucleus), the more stable the self becomes, the thinner the center becomes. Eventually, the equilibrated self has only an emtpy center.
				- Being at the center of the self, the obop is the nexus of communication and interaction for all components of the self-circle. It's the knot of effect threads and the focal point of effect flows within the self-circle.

			- **Perspective Flip**: Something "falling from heaven" is a good opportunity for humans down on Earth. The closing outside, like a black hole or a closing of a day, is the opening inside, like a white hole or an opening of a night.
			- **Convergence for Explosion**: The closing isn’t just a negative end (death, decline); it’s a convergence of conditions, like a sunset or a black hole collapsing externally, that sets the stage for an "explosion" of opportunity, like a sunrise or a white hole opening internally, a preparation for new beginnings (reborn, germination).
			- **Transformative Technique**: This flip can be applied as a mindset – viewing a "closing" (e.g., a failure or end) not as a negative end but as a convergence point that prepares for a new "opening" (e.g., a fresh start or opportunity).

						- The [hyperbolic angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_angle) $ψ$ is defined to be double the area of the corresponding hyperbolic sector.
							- Actually, this definition is the same for all conic angles agains conic sectors.
						- Hyperbolic rotation is a [squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeeze_mapping) with **squeeze factor** $k = e^ψ$ which is the up-scale factor along $x = y$ and the down-scale factor along $x+y=0$.
						- The corresponding (circular) angle $ψ_c$ between the radial (squeezed) line and the horizontal line: 
						  $\tanh(ψ) = \tan(ψ_c)$
					- **Edge sync**: Project the shear line up to the light cone $z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$, then project to xOz plane, then reflect back to xOy plane, i.e., the sheared line is mirrored into the horizontal line:
					  $\tanh(ψ) = \tan(ψ_c) = \sin(φ) = s/\sqrt{1+s^2}$

					  id:: 67e64337-65df-48fd-af37-3ee21245e154
					- On Cartesian grid, the y-parabolic rotation moves objects along the vertical lines $x^2 = r^2$, and x-parabolic rotation along the horizontal lines $y^2 = r^2$.
					- On hyperbolic grid, the standard hyperbolic rotation moves objects along the “vertical” lines $(x^2 - y^2)^2 = r^4$, and the standard squeeze mapping along the “horizontal” lines $(2xy)^2 = r^4$.
					- These grids are the conic version of [orthogonal coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_coordinates) which are the most common cases of [curvilinear coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvilinear_coordinates).

						- While the **shear** is *usually thought as unidirectional*, its **bidirectional** nature, i.e. rotating around the origin, is stressed with the pair of lines (a degenerate parabola) $x^2 = r^2$ instead of single lines $x = r$.
						- Transforming the complex plane, we have similar grids (some with distortions):
							- **Cartesian grid** $(u+iv)$ is the standard complex plane.
							- **Polar grid** $\exp(\ln u+iv)$ has circles expanding uniformly against $u$.
								- The [log-lin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-log_plot#log%E2%80%93linear_plot) grid $(\ln u+iv)$ is useful for data with exponential relationships.
								- [Log-polar grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-polar_coordinates) $\exp(u+iv)$ has circles expanding exponentially against $u$, i.e., the coordinate $u$ is the logarithm of the radius of the corresponding circle on the grid.
							- **Hyperbolic grid** $\sqrt{u^2+iv^2}$ has hyperbolas spacing uniformly against $u, v$.
								- **Squared hyperbolic grid** $\sqrt{u+iv}$ has hyperbolas spacing in square roots of $u, v$, i.e., coordinates $u, v$ are squares of the distance from the corresponding hyperbola on the grid to the origin.
						- Notes:
							- Don't confuse the Cartesian grid $(u+iv)$ with the [“parabolic grid”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_coordinates) $(u+iv)^2$.
							- The [“radial hyperbolic coordinates”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_coordinates) is different from the “orthogonal hyperbolic coordinates” above in that the “vertical lines” are radial lines $x/y = e^{2r}$, instead of hyperbolas $(x^2 - y^2)^2 = r^4$. This grid with radials is not orthogonal and is used in relativity physics.

					- Spacetime distortion of proper spacetime when projected onto a flat Cartesian coordinate system:
					  id:: 67c1273d-c336-4203-bc0d-68150f382c72
						- *Compression/Contraction*: Proper distance/interval at the herenow is greater than the coordinate distance/interval observed by an external observer.
						- *Stretch/Dilation*: Proper distance/interval at the herenow is less than the coordinate distance/interval observed by an external observer.
					- Spacetime distribution around a massive object, like the Sun 🌞, as shown in [Schwarzschild metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric)
						- Spacetime interval ($ds$) and proper time interval ($dτ$) in spherical coordinates $(t, r, θ, φ)$ with signature convention (+, -, -, -)
						  $${ds}^2 = c^2 {dτ}^2 \;=\; ( 1 - \frac{R_s}{r} )c^2 {dt}^2 \; - ( 1 - \frac{R_s}{r} )^{-1} dr^2 \; - r^2 {dΩ}^2$$
						  with ${dΩ}^2 = ({dθ}^2 + (\sin θ)^2 {dφ}^2)$ and [Schwarzschild radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius) $R_s = {2GM}/{c^2}$
						- **Stretch/dilation** of time: The coefficient $(1 - R_s/r)$ of  ${dt}^2$ is large near the Sun. This means that proper time intervals are shorter than coordinate time intervals.
						- **Compression/contraction** of radial distances: The coefficient $(1 - R_s/r)^{-1}$ of ${dr}^2$ is small near the Sun. This means that proper radial distances are greater than coordinate radial distances.
						- These coefficients have the same form with the [Lorentz factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor) $γ^2$ in Special Relativity: $γ^2 = (1 - (v/c)^2)^{-1}$
							- $γ^2 = (1 - β^2)^{-1}$ : $β = v/c$ in SR (Lorentz), and $β = \sqrt{R_s/r}$ in GR (Schwarzschild)
							- When the object **flies faster** ($v↑$) in SR, or **approaches the center** ($r↓$) in GR, 
							  $γ↓$ makes **length contract** and **time dilate**.
						- Both coordinate view and visual view of the space from a distant observer show space contractions with some differences.
							- The visual [radius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_radius) of [Einstein ring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_ring) is smaller than the Schwarzschild radius due to [gravitational lensing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens).

						- Due to the traditional image of [curved spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curved_spacetime) from Einstein, many LLM chatbots are confused between the “stretch of space” of the model of [“heavy objects on a rubber sheet”](((67c11c75-41db-404c-a349-dd4b4876851d))) and the “compressed space” in spacetime distribution.

							- Stuck in confusion between curvature & distribution: Copilot, DeepSeek
							- Arrived at the language of distribution: Grok 3, Meta AI
								- Meta AI still had some confusions at first but quickly corrected after my suggestions.
								- Grok 3 directly [described](https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_41d4563d-f787-47cb-adfa-66cc81da8f08) the distribution in the language of density without any suggestion 😊. However, further refinements revealed many confusions. I've tried hard to resolve those confusions and finally complete the 3-way relativity.
								  id:: 67f4eae8-b7f3-44af-b6fe-61591204f245
									- Grok 3 still have severe hallucinations, e.g. it thinks that it can read Web pages for any given URL while [it cannot](https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_e996d9cd-5621-404a-8c47-f9ebb9f0719f), as well as [other cases reported on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43177346).

				- So, the balance way should be using both: distribution for introductory level and curvatures for adavanced level.
				  collapsed:: true
					- By using both distribution and curvature, students can develop a deeper understanding of general relativity and its underlying principles.
					- The Benefits of Distribution
						- *Easier visualization*: Distribution is a more tangible concept, allowing students to visualize how spacetime changes around massive objects.
						- *Simpler language*: Describing spacetime in terms of distribution avoids the complexities of curvature, making it easier for students to grasp.
						- *More relatable*: Distribution is a concept that can be related to everyday experiences, such as stretching or compressing materials.

						- Through time, its meaning has shifted to be “right or suitable for a _particular_ situation or purpose” → “truly what something is said or regarded to be; genuine; suitable or appropriate in society”.
						- Examples of the meaning “suitable for a _particular_ situation”:
							- Proper to itself
							  > She likes everything to be in _its **proper**_ place.
							- Proper to me
							  > I've had sandwiches but I haven't eaten a **proper** meal.
							- Proper to the job

			- Copilot suggests "spooling" & "entwining".
			  collapsed:: true
				- While "entwining" is good for its broad sense, "spooling" is good for its common usage in computing and capturing both "spooling in" and "spooling out".
				- For a thick coil with many loops in between, "spooling" is a great term which can be combined with "rolling": at the two ends, the thread is "spooled in/out", while in between, it just rolls/rotates around.
				- I'm thinking of the new term “spool-rolling” or “sprolling” /sprol.ɪŋ/ to combine “spooling” & “rolling”!
					- While “[rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling) = rotation + translation”, “sprolling = winding + translation”
					- The slang “[sproll](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sproll)” can be “spin + roll” or “spam + troll”.
					- Don't be confused with “sprawling” /sprɔːl.ɪŋ/

			- For a single loop ➰ and when it degenerates into just a (soliton) wave packet, its motion is the combination between the "propagation" in the direction of the the main thread and the "curling in & out" of the loop/packet.
			- In general, there are 3 parts of this movement: thread input, rotating inside, and thread output.
				- In Unithread view, all [bodies](((66c810a0-9861-4787-bdcf-1378219332be))) in the worlds, from celestial bodies, organisms (thread = food & info), to simple physical objects (thread = energy), are "living" (existing) by this movement. The difference is just how complicated the "rotation" inside that body is.
				- I think “**transcycling** = cycling + translation” should be an apt term for this general movement.
					- “transcycling = cycling + exchange (I/O)”: the bicycle cycling, itself, includes the translation of the bicycle and the exchange of momentum, but i add the prefix “trans” to stress the intrinsic exchange of content, transition of state, transformation of thread.
					- About the verb “to ((687743fd-9d45-45be-b9fd-3055cbb8a938))”: When an obop transcycles *on/along* the thread from left to right, it transcycles the thread through its body and effectively makes the thread move from right to left relative to the obop.

						- Intransitive verb: “to transcycle on somebody” ~ “to cycle on road” ~ “to traverse some place”

				- “transcycling” is close to “traversal”, with “cycle” ~ “verse = turn”!
					- ((678b72d3-073a-4763-a49f-5233a3d86614))
					- The “turn” in “traversal” is the change (nearly reverse) of direction in the zigzag course or switchback: to exhaustively traverse a flat space, we must switchback many times.
						- A milder “turn” is the “turn away” (nearly perpendicularly) from the main direction of the flow/river/road to **cross over** it, i.e. the original meaning of the Latin verb “[traversare](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/traversare)”.
					- “turn” ~ “rotate”: in maths, “turn = cycle” like “[turn of rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(knot)) = round loop of rope”, “[1 turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle)) = 1 cycle” 1τ = 2π

			- Pattern matching: The intent circle is the form to extract effect circle from the content, i.e. it is turned by the matched content.
			- Analysis: The intent circle just hashes the content into its own distribution (connection & order).
			- Organization: The intent sorts the content out into its knowledge cone.
			- The mechanism of this unmixing is the same as the interunion, only reverse in direction of the effect flows: from the product back to intent circles
				- This symmetry is the nature of the interunion operation: (x, y) -> (x', y') has 2 families of cones: mixing cones (x, y) -> x'; (x, y) -> y'; and unmixing cones x -> (x', y'); y -> (x', y').
