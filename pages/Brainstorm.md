			- First, plan the time of working hours.
				- A working day should start from official works instead of personal works.
					- This is a good strategy but difficult for me because the out-of-work thoughts from the last night will naturally continue in the morning, keeping me from focusing on other works.
					- So, let's try using breathwork and meditation to switch the flow of thought from personal to official works.
				- Previously, i designed a [⟪Back to Work!⟫ reminder](((67d2a63d-58de-4dbe-bbec-3ec8625737c7))) but ineffective.
			- Second, plan the space of thoughts.
				- Due to the ((681b3ad7-d1b0-4c06-a4ea-385a4a9314e0)) and various deep intents, all works, including official works and even the balancing work, will trigger meta-thoughts deeply related to ((66537a44-f579-4fcc-a02b-2f32d0d409fc)). So the time planning only is not enough.
					- My ((665379b7-e4f6-4240-8029-fd143e2230c7)) has already been supporting Unïnfo strongly: observing the intents & obops => expose them, detach them, and write them down to UniinfoNotes

					- Here, $P_D$ is the “parallelized point” of $D$, i.e., $ABCP_D$ is the parallelogram erected from the triangle $ABC$.
						- That means $DP_D$ is the deviation of $ABCD$ from the parallelogram $ABCP_D$.
					- When $M, N$ are midpoints of the two diagonals $AC, BD$, then $DP_D = 2MN$, and we have another formula:

			- Thanks to its zero intent, the empty center = self-essence = Nibbāna = the non-self (Anattā) has infinite extent coverring everything, hence the great Self (Ātman).
			- The empty center is an **ideal obop**, an obop without self/intent, a “selfless obop”, i.e. the limit of obop when its intent approaches zero.
				- The emtpy self-essence is just a focal point, a ((66728236-5b19-425c-bb5f-dfc0dc8b79fd)), an abstraction, not a concrete self.
				- Being focused & projected from the ((669a5387-2a97-4311-a295-aa0afd9c4d76))s around, the visible self-essence (as an empty center) cannot exist on its own. In other words, the self-essence itself has no essence.
				- The “invisible self-essence”, usually called “Nibbāna”, is immanent in everything. In other words, everything has a self-essence which is empty. This immanence is because nothing can obstruct a thing with zero intent, thus the zero-intent Nibbāna permeates everything.
				- Though empty, the central role of the self-essence in the self makes it essential to every self.
					- All parts of the self-circle are integrated by focusing on the same center. Via that center, they all are one, seeing/feeling/treating each other as the same ((66c810a0-9861-4787-bdcf-1378219332be)) of self.
					- When a self-circle loses its center, it just ceases to exist as itself and disintegrates into smaller circles.
					- Such essence of the empty center is can be seen in the hub of the wheel.

				- In a ((6851578b-9b1f-4367-878f-79b0b0b9be51)) with multiple layers of self-circle,
					- each self-circle has an obop which is just another self-circle inside, and
					- the limit of this inward stepping is the self-essence, i.e. the apex of the double cone.
			- The formation of a self starts with the closure of its self-circle, i.e. ((66e40f4b-34ae-499a-8192-0a0f4f580c7e)), 
			  sustained by the conservation of its content, i.e. ((66e40f58-c9dd-47f4-999d-2e4a2aa874fe)), 
			  and stablized by the central obop so that it can crystallize into a round circle i.e. ((66e40f75-0573-484e-8cb6-b6b8071ffb8c)).

			- **Negative to Positive Flip in Etymology**: From "occidō" with negative senses (down, decline, death), it has been transformed to "occasio" with positive sense (opportunity).
			- **Perspective Flip**: Something "falling from heaven" is a good opportunity for humans down on Earth. The closing outside, like a black hole or a closing of a day, is the opening inside, like a white hole or an opening of a night.
			- **Convergence for Explosion**: The closing isn’t just a negative end (death, decline); it’s a convergence of conditions, like a sunset or a black hole collapsing externally, that sets the stage for an "explosion" of opportunity, like a sunrise or a white hole opening internally, a preparation for new beginnings (reborn, germination).
			- **Transformative Technique**: This flip can be applied as a mindset—viewing a "closing" (e.g., a failure or end) not as a negative end but as a convergence point that prepares for a new "opening" (e.g., a fresh start or opportunity).

				- However, the spacetime distribution represented by its density is much more intuitive and more fundamental, which is defined directly by the metric tensor $g_{μν}$ as the ((669a58b9-eb34-41cd-8605-02e29b07e1b5)) of spacetime.

					- Spacetime distortion of proper spacetime when projected onto a flat Cartesian coordinate system:
					  id:: 67c1273d-c336-4203-bc0d-68150f382c72
						- *Compression/Contraction*: Proper distance/interval at the herenow is greater than the coordinate distance/interval observed by an external observer.
						- *Stretch/Dilation*: Proper distance/interval at the herenow is less than the coordinate distance/interval observed by an external observer.
					- Spacetime distribution around a massive object, like the Sun 🌞, as shown in [Schwarzschild metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric)
						- Spacetime interval ($ds$) and proper time interval ($dτ$) in spherical coordinates $(t, r, θ, φ)$ with signature convention (+, -, -, -)
						  $${ds}^2 = c^2 {dτ}^2 \;=\; ( 1 - \frac{R_s}{r} )c^2 {dt}^2 \; - ( 1 - \frac{R_s}{r} )^{-1} dr^2 \; - r^2 {dΩ}^2$$
						  with ${dΩ}^2 = ({dθ}^2 + (\sin θ)^2 {dφ}^2)$ and [Schwarzschild radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius) $R_s = {2GM}/{c^2}$
						- **Stretch/dilation** of time: The coefficient $(1 - R_s/r)$ of  ${dt}^2$ is large near the Sun. This means that proper time intervals are shorter than coordinate time intervals.
						- **Compression/contraction** of radial distances: The coefficient $(1 - R_s/r)^{-1}$ of ${dr}^2$ is small near the Sun. This means that proper radial distances are greater than coordinate radial distances.
						- These coefficients have the same form with the [Lorentz factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor) $γ^2$ in Special Relativity: $γ^2 = (1 - (v/c)^2)^{-1}$
							- $γ^2 = (1 - β^2)^{-1}$ : $β = v/c$ in SR (Lorentz), and $β = \sqrt{R_s/r}$ in GR (Schwarzschild)
							- When the object **flies faster** ($v↑$) in SR, or **approaches the center** ($r↓$) in GR, 
							  $γ↓$ makes **length contract** and **time dilate**.
						- Both coordinate view and visual view of the space from a distant observer show space contractions with some differences.
							- The visual [radius](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_radius) of [Einstein ring](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_ring) is smaller than the Schwarzschild radius due to [gravitational lensing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens).
							- Objects near [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon) is warped arround visually, while it's just infinitely dense in coordinate view.

						- Due to the traditional image of [curved spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curved_spacetime) from Einstein, many LLM chatbots are confused between the “stretch of space” of the model of [“heavy objects on a rubber sheet”](((67c11c75-41db-404c-a349-dd4b4876851d))) and the “compressed space” in spacetime distribution.

							- Stuck in confusion between curvature & distribution: Copilot, DeepSeek
							- Arrived at the language of distribution: Grok 3, Meta AI
								- Meta AI still had some confusions at first but quickly corrected after my suggestions.
								- Grok 3 directly [described](https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_41d4563d-f787-47cb-adfa-66cc81da8f08) the distribution in the language of density without any suggestion 😊. However, further refinements revealed many confusions. I've tried hard to resolve those confusions and finally complete the 3-way relativity.
								  id:: 67f4eae8-b7f3-44af-b6fe-61591204f245
									- Grok 3 still have severe hallucinations, e.g. it thinks that it can read Web pages for any given URL while [it cannot](https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_e996d9cd-5621-404a-8c47-f9ebb9f0719f), as well as [other cases reported on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43177346).

				- So, the balance way should be using both: distribution for introductory level and curvatures for adavanced level.
				  collapsed:: true
					- By using both distribution and curvature, students can develop a deeper understanding of general relativity and its underlying principles.
					- The Benefits of Distribution
						- *Easier visualization*: Distribution is a more tangible concept, allowing students to visualize how spacetime changes around massive objects.
						- *Simpler language*: Describing spacetime in terms of distribution avoids the complexities of curvature, making it easier for students to grasp.
						- *More relatable*: Distribution is a concept that can be related to everyday experiences, such as stretching or compressing materials.
					- The Role of Curvature
						- [Curvature = force](((67b5c77d-c42c-4dc5-8d47-fd82f535177a))) in [equivalence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle)

				- The curvature/distortion of spacetime has proved the ancient wisdom that _only the **herenow**, i.e. the local reference point/frame is proper_. Anything out of the herenow is distorted, hence improper! 😊

					- Etymology: Latin [proprius](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/proprius#Latin) (own, individual, private) → French [propre](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/propre#French) (own, specific, particular, appropriate, correct) → English: proper, property, appropriate
						- Through time, its meaning has shifted to be “right or suitable for a _particular_ situation or purpose” → “truly what something is said or regarded to be; genuine; suitable or appropriate in society”.
						- Examples of the meaning “suitable for a _particular_ situation”:
							- Proper to itself
							  > She likes everything to be in _its **proper**_ place.
							- Proper to me
							  > I've had sandwiches but I haven't eaten a **proper** meal.
							- Proper to the job
							  > I would have done the job myself but I didn't have the **proper** equipment.
							- Proper to the walk
							  > If you're going to walk long distances you need **proper** walking boots.
					- Usages of “proper” as “own, specific”: proper name/noun, [proper motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_motion), proper to
					- Some examples using “**proper to**” (given by Copilot) to highlights that certain characteristics, roles, or practices belong specifically to a particular context, group, or individual.
						- 1. Cultural Practices
						  > These rituals are **proper to** the local community and have been passed down through generations.
						- 2. Geographical Features
						  > The flora and fauna **proper to** this region are unique and diverse.
						- 3. Customs and Traditions
						  > The dress code **proper to** this occasion requires formal attire.
						- 4. Specialized Roles
						  > The duties **proper to** a physician include diagnosing and treating patients.
						- 5. Legal Context
						  > The responsibilities **proper to** a trustee are outlined in the legal document.

			- Copilot suggests "spooling" & "entwining".
			  collapsed:: true
				- While "entwining" is good for its broad sense, "spooling" is good for its common usage in computing and capturing both "spooling in" and "spooling out".
				- For a thick coil with many loops in between, "spooling" is a great term which can be combined with "rolling": at the two ends, the thread is "spooled in/out", while in between, it just rolls/rotates around.
				- I'm thinking of the new term “spool-rolling” or “sprolling” /sprol.ɪŋ/ to combine “spooling” & “rolling”!
					- While “[rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling) = rotation + translation”, “sprolling = winding + translation”
					- The slang “[sproll](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sproll)” can be “spin + roll” or “spam + troll”.
					- Don't be confused with “sprawling” /sprɔːl.ɪŋ/
					- Related to the hot “rolling spool”.

			- For a single loop ➰ and when it degenerates into just a (soliton) wave packet, its motion is the combination between the "propagation" in the direction of the the main thread and the "curling in & out" of the loop/packet.
			- In general, there are 3 parts of this movement: thread input, rotating inside, and thread output.
				- In Unithread view, all [bodies](((66c810a0-9861-4787-bdcf-1378219332be))) in the worlds, from celestial bodies, organisms (thread = food & info), to simple physical objects (thread = energy), are "living" (existing) by this movement. The difference is just how complicated the "rotation" inside that body is.
				- I think “**transcycling** = cycling + translation” should be an apt term for this general movement.
					- “transcycling = cycling + exchange (I/O)”: the bicycle cycling, itself, includes the translation of the bicycle and the exchange of momentum, but i add the prefix “trans” to stress the intrinsic exchange of content, transition of state, transformation of thread.
					- Verb “to transcycle”: When an obop transcycles *on/along* the thread from left to right, it transcycles the thread through its body and effectively makes the thread move from right to left relative to the obop.

						- Intransitive verb: “to transcycle on somebody” ~ “to cycle on road” ~ “to traverse some place”
						- Transitive verb: “to transcycle something” ~ “to recycle something”
							- Passive voice: “something is transcycled through somebody” ~ “something is cycled through somebody” ~ “somebody cycles through something's contents” (e.g. “The Earth climate cycles through the warm El Niño phase, the neutral phase and the cool La Niña phase.” )
				- “transcycling” is close to “traversal”, with “cycle” ~ “verse = turn”!
					- ((678b72d3-073a-4763-a49f-5233a3d86614))
					- The “turn” in “traversal” is the change (nearly reverse) of direction in the zigzag course or switchback: to exhaustively traverse a flat space, we must switchback many times.
						- A milder “turn” is the “turn away” (nearly perpendicularly) from the main direction of the flow/river/road to **cross over** it, i.e. the original meaning of the Latin verb “[traversare](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/traversare)”.
					- “turn” ~ “rotate”: in maths, “turn = cycle” like “[turn of rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(knot)) = round loop of rope”, “[1 turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle)) = 1 cycle” 1τ = 2π

			- The mixed object's content is projected through different view cones to different images (extents) by different intent circles ⭕. All obops are watching the object in parallel with their different interests (intents).
			- Pattern matching: The intent circle is the form to extract effect circle from the content, i.e. it is turned by the matched content.
			- Analysis: The intent circle just hashes the content into its own distribution (connection & order).
			- Organization: The intent sorts the content out into its knowledge cone.
			- The mechanism of this unmixing is the same as the interunion, only reverse in direction of the effect flows: from the product back to intent circles
				- This symmetry is the nature of the interunion operation: (x, y) -> (x', y') has 2 families of cones: mixing cones (x, y) -> x'; (x, y) -> y'; and unmixing cones x -> (x', y'); y -> (x', y').
