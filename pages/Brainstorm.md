			- First, plan the time of working hours.
				- A working day should start from official works instead of personal works.
					- This is a good strategy but difficult for me because the out-of-work thoughts from the last night will naturally continue in the morning, keeping me from focusing on other works.

			- Normally, people [trust a trustee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_(social_science)) with the _**presumption** that the trustee will act in ways that benefit the trustor_.
			- That presumption is but an illusion! 😜 So, that normal trust is just a *false trust*, i.e. **half trust**.

					- “I let you in. I **open** myself. I’m **willing to be affected** by you.”

					- Essentially, we must trust because we are **finite** beings in an **uncertain** world.
						- We never have complete knowledge.
						- We never have full control.
						- We cannot verify everything ourselves.
					- Trust is **how we cross the gaps** between:
						- known and unknown,
						- self and other,
						- past and future,
						- present and absent.
					- If we didn’t trust *anything or anyone*, we couldn’t:
						- drink a glass of water (do you test it yourself each time?),
						- cross a bridge (do you inspect every beam?),
						- listen to a teacher, doctor, or friend,
						- fall asleep while others are still awake,
						- *love*.
					- So **trust is not optional** – it’s the glue of life.
						- It’s what the philosopher Annette Baier called *“the atmosphere of trust”* – like oxygen: unnoticed when present, suffocating when absent.

				  id:: 68a566be-4e50-41d5-9213-bfb80178bc18
					- **The trustor bears responsibility** for *choosing* to trust, for judging the risks, and for _accepting the **inherent vulnerability**_.
					- The **trustee** bears responsibility for *honouring* that trust, through care, integrity, and effort – but not for controlling every outcome.
					- **Self-responsibility** is the key to make the trust grounded, deep, and strong.
						- While normaly, the **half trust** is dependent on the trustee, cut off from the trustor’s own responsibility.
							- It’s like leaning on one leg and blaming the ground when you fall.
							- It's fragile – collapses when unmet expectations surface.
						- **Complete trust** contains both poles: the openness toward the trustee *and* the self-responsibility of the trustor. It’s whole, stable, and strong.
						- Actually, no one is responsible for your own life, but you yourself!
				- Nuance: Don't confuse this “complete trust” with the common “absolute trust”.
				  collapsed:: true
					- **Absolute trust**: Trust without limits, conditions, or doubt.
						- Absoluteness *usually* means **blind reliance**: the trustor yields all responsibility.
						- **Brittleness**: the trustor collapses if the trustee fails.
					- **Complete trust**: Trust that includes not only belief, reliance, but also self-responsibility.
						- **Core feature:** Wholeness, balance, self-contained openness.
						- **Resilience:** Not destroyed by betrayal, because the trustor doesn’t abandon self-responsibility.
					- While that usual “absolute trust” is still a false trust, 
					  the *truly absolute trust* is the **absolute complete trust**:
					  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
					  unconditional, independent from the trustee’s behavior
					  thanks to self-responsibility
					  #+END_QUOTE
						- We can rely fully because we're standing fully on our own feet.
					- In short:

						- Usual absolute trust is brittle with blind rigidity.

				- #### Three Faces of Trust
					- A hand half-open, half-closed – 
					  offering yet withholding,
					  leaning forward, leaning back,
					  never whole, never still.
					  Suspicion clings like shadow,
					  and the bond breaks
					  at the touch of weight:
					  this fragile face – *half trust*.
					- Eyes shut against the dark,
					  a heart surrendered without seeing –
					  this is the dream of certainty.
					  Strong as stone on the surface,
					  hollow at the core,
					  it cracks when truth arrives,
					  for blindness cannot bear the light:
					  this rigid mask – *blind absolute trust*.
					- Roots deep in the earth,
					  bamboo sways with the storm.
					  Here trust stands clear-eyed,
					  responsibility carried within,
					  risk neither denied nor feared.
					  It bends, it holds, it breathes –
					  a faith unbroken, resilient and free:
					  this living heart – *absolute complete trust*.

					  Nghi ngờ như bóng theo đuôi,
					  Chỉ cần sức nặng, rã rời dây liên.
					  Mỏng manh mặt ấy hiện lên –
					  *Niềm tin dở nửa* chênh vênh cõi người.
					- Đưa chân mắt nhắm miệng cười,
					  Trao tim phó thác cho người chẳng nghi.
					  Mơ hồ giấc mộng khắc ghi,
					  Ngoài thì vững chãi, ruột thì rỗng không.
					  Sự thật đến, vỡ tan lòng,
					  Mù lòa sao chịu ánh quang sáng ngời.
					  Khô cứng mặt nạ một thời –
					  *Niềm tin tuyệt đối mù* rơi bóng mờ.
					- Rễ sâu bám đất đợi chờ,
					  Tre mềm đón bão chẳng nề ngả nghiêng.
					  Niềm tin mắt sáng hiện nguyên,
					  Tự mang trách nhiệm, chẳng phiền sợ chi.
					  Đón gian khổ, chẳng lẩn đi,
					  Dù cong dù thẳng, chẳng bì chẳng so.
					  *Niềm tin trọn vẹn*, chẳng rò –
					  Vững vàng tuyệt đối há lo lắng gì.

			- Belief → {confidence, conviction, trust} → faith
				- **Belief**: **Holding** something to be **true**; intellectual **acceptance**, a judgment about reality.
					- **Confidence**: assurance or feeling of **certainty**; usually about oneself (self-belief), but also about others
					- **Conviction**: **firm** and unwavering belief
					- While both are strong belief, “confidence” is about practical competence, “conviction” is about principled truth.
						- “I am confident this **will** work / they **can** do it” versus
						- “I have conviction in this mechanism / their ability” = “I **know** this works / they're able to do it.”
				- **Trust**: Relationship and **reliability**: Reliance on someone/something with confidence
					- The confidence is usually a belief that _“it won’t let me down”_.
					- However, a [wholesome trust](((68a595fa-385c-49a7-820f-67aa9db632d5))) should be based on the confidence of the trustor about its own acceptance of reality, and about the completeness of the life built upon trust.
				- **Faith**: Deeper than belief, broader than trust. It mixes conviction, trust, commitment, and usually with loyalty or devotion.
				- While English splits *belief / trust / faith* into separate roots, Vietnamese folds them back into **one root “tin”** (信), then fans it out with qualifiers (*tự, chắc, cậy, nhiệm, thác, lòng, đức*).
					- **Belief**: “niềm **tin**” (plain cognitive assent)
						- **Confidence**: “**tự** tin” (self-belief),
						- **Conviction**: “tin **chắc**” (assertion)
					- **Trust**: “tin **cậy**” (personal), “tín **nhiệm**” (social), “tín **thác**” (entrustment)
						- **Tín thác** = *tín nhiệm* (confidence in) + *phó thác* (entrustment)
						  Strong match for English *trust*, especially in the sense of “placing oneself in the care of another”.
					- **Faith**: “**lòng** tin” (heart-deepened), “**đức** tin” (virtue-elevated)

			- From [boredom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boredom), pleasure/food cloyedness, to romantic disillusionment and even career burnout, the jadedness of people has shown the duality of pleasure and displeasure as well as the hidden fantasy in everyone.
			- Expectations & imaginative projection are the key of jadedness.
				- Expectation as an imagination bubble
					- People pre-load experiences with an imagined flavour based on signs (appearance, reputation, first impression).
					- The early enjoyment is partly *self-generated fantasy*, not reality-based content.
				- Reality’s slow reveal
					- As the real texture of the thing emerges – the *actual* taste of the food, the *actual* rhythm of the work – it inevitably differs from the fantasy.
					- This difference erodes the imagined sweetness.
				- The emotional crash = jadedness
					- Once the imagined pleasure fades, people are left with a baseline reality they never truly connected to, so it feels flat or even unpleasant.
					- The “sweet imagination” being annihilated, leaving only the “bitter reality”, people feel jaded, bored, sated.
				- Liberation
					- By avoiding expectation, accepting reality, not clinging to the superficial forms, enjoying the deep content, refraining from imagination, we won't be jaded or sick of anything.
					- By avoiding expectation and refraining from imaginative projection, we will meet reality *as it is* from the start.
					- Our joy will come from engaging with the **deep content**, which doesn’t wear out the way fantasies do.

			- Moderation is the way to avoid surfeit.

						- The control is determined by the view => out of view = out of control.
					- The empty center has the highest order because there's nothing left behind to control. To the empty center, everything is object, no more agent.
				- Because the empty center has higher order than the circled center (with form, self),
				- we practice relying on the empty center, the selfless obop, to let the crystal form be in contact with the formless content, so that it can be transformed easily.
					- When a form collides with another form, it resists change by trying to preserve its own form.
					- But when a form touches the content, it absorbs naturally, hence changes effortlessly.
			- These practices are just skillful means that applies the truth into our own life.

			- Thanks to its zero intent, the empty center = self-essence = Nibbāna = the non-self (Anattā) has infinite extent coverring everything, hence the great Self (Ātman).
			- The empty center is an **ideal obop**, an obop without self/intent, a “selfless obop”, i.e. the limit of obop when its intent approaches zero.
				- The emtpy self-essence is just a focal point, a ((66728236-5b19-425c-bb5f-dfc0dc8b79fd)), an abstraction, not a concrete self.
				- Being focused & projected from the ((669a5387-2a97-4311-a295-aa0afd9c4d76))s around, the visible self-essence (as an empty center) cannot exist on its own. In other words, the self-essence itself has no essence.
				- The “invisible self-essence”, usually called “Nibbāna”, is immanent in everything. In other words, everything has a self-essence which is empty. This immanence is because nothing can obstruct a thing with zero intent, thus the zero-intent Nibbāna permeates everything.
				- Though empty, the central role of the self-essence in the self makes it essential to every self.
					- All parts of the self-circle are integrated by focusing on the same center. Via that center, they all are one, seeing/feeling/treating each other as the same ((66c810a0-9861-4787-bdcf-1378219332be)) of self.
					- When a self-circle loses its center, it just ceases to exist as itself and disintegrates into smaller circles.
					- Such essence of the empty center is can be seen in the hub of the wheel.

				- In a ((6851578b-9b1f-4367-878f-79b0b0b9be51)) with multiple layers of self-circle,
					- each self-circle has an obop which is just another self-circle inside, and
					- the limit of this inward stepping is the self-essence, i.e. the apex of the double cone.
			- The formation of a self starts with the closure of its self-circle, i.e. ((66e40f4b-34ae-499a-8192-0a0f4f580c7e)), 
			  sustained by the conservation of its content, i.e. ((66e40f58-c9dd-47f4-999d-2e4a2aa874fe)), 
			  and stablized by the central obop so that it can crystallize into a round circle i.e. ((66e40f75-0573-484e-8cb6-b6b8071ffb8c)).
				- Even though the intial “seed” at the center is solid (a concrete obop), like the [ice nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_nucleus), the more stable the self becomes, the thinner the center becomes. Eventually, the equilibrated self has only an emtpy center.
				- Being at the center of the self, the obop is the nexus of communication and interaction for all components of the self-circle. It's the knot of effect threads and the focal point of effect flows within the self-circle.

			- **Convergence for Explosion**: The closing isn’t just a negative end (death, decline); it’s a convergence of conditions, like a sunset or a black hole collapsing externally, that sets the stage for an "explosion" of opportunity, like a sunrise or a white hole opening internally, a preparation for new beginnings (reborn, germination).
			- **Transformative Technique**: This flip can be applied as a mindset – viewing a "closing" (e.g., a failure or end) not as a negative end but as a convergence point that prepares for a new "opening" (e.g., a fresh start or opportunity).

							- **Hyperbolic grid** $\sqrt{u^2+iv^2}$ has hyperbolas spacing uniformly against $u, v$.
								- **Squared hyperbolic grid** $\sqrt{u+iv}$ has hyperbolas spacing in square roots of $u, v$, i.e., coordinates $u, v$ are squares of the distance from the corresponding hyperbola on the grid to the origin.

					- Spacetime distortion of proper spacetime when projected onto a flat Cartesian coordinate system:
					  id:: 67c1273d-c336-4203-bc0d-68150f382c72
						- *Compression/Contraction*: Proper distance/interval at the herenow is greater than the coordinate distance/interval observed by an external observer.
						- *Stretch/Dilation*: Proper distance/interval at the herenow is less than the coordinate distance/interval observed by an external observer.
					- Spacetime distribution around a massive object, like the Sun 🌞, as shown in [Schwarzschild metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric)
						- Spacetime interval ($ds$) and proper time interval ($dτ$) in spherical coordinates $(t, r, θ, φ)$ with signature convention (+, -, -, -)
						  $${ds}^2 = c^2 {dτ}^2 \;=\; ( 1 - \frac{R_s}{r} )c^2 {dt}^2 \; - ( 1 - \frac{R_s}{r} )^{-1} dr^2 \; - r^2 {dΩ}^2$$
						  with ${dΩ}^2 = ({dθ}^2 + (\sin θ)^2 {dφ}^2)$ and [Schwarzschild radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius) $R_s = {2GM}/{c^2}$
						- **Stretch/dilation** of time: The coefficient $(1 - R_s/r)$ of  ${dt}^2$ is large near the Sun. This means that proper time intervals are shorter than coordinate time intervals.
						- **Compression/contraction** of radial distances: The coefficient $(1 - R_s/r)^{-1}$ of ${dr}^2$ is small near the Sun. This means that proper radial distances are greater than coordinate radial distances.
						- These coefficients have the same form with the [Lorentz factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor) $γ^2$ in Special Relativity: $γ^2 = (1 - (v/c)^2)^{-1}$
							- $γ^2 = (1 - β^2)^{-1}$ : $β = v/c$ in SR (Lorentz), and $β = \sqrt{R_s/r}$ in GR (Schwarzschild)
							- When the object **flies faster** ($v↑$) in SR, or **approaches the center** ($r↓$) in GR, 
							  $γ↓$ makes **length contract** and **time dilate**.
						- Both coordinate view and visual view of the space from a distant observer show space contractions with some differences.

								- Meta AI still had some confusions at first but quickly corrected after my suggestions.

				- So, the balance way should be using both: distribution for introductory level and curvatures for adavanced level.
				  collapsed:: true
					- By using both distribution and curvature, students can develop a deeper understanding of general relativity and its underlying principles.
					- The Benefits of Distribution
						- *Easier visualization*: Distribution is a more tangible concept, allowing students to visualize how spacetime changes around massive objects.
						- *Simpler language*: Describing spacetime in terms of distribution avoids the complexities of curvature, making it easier for students to grasp.
						- *More relatable*: Distribution is a concept that can be related to everyday experiences, such as stretching or compressing materials.

						- Through time, its meaning has shifted to be “right or suitable for a _particular_ situation or purpose” → “truly what something is said or regarded to be; genuine; suitable or appropriate in society”.
						- Examples of the meaning “suitable for a _particular_ situation”:
							- Proper to itself

				- I'm thinking of the new term “spool-rolling” or “sprolling” /sprol.ɪŋ/ to combine “spooling” & “rolling”!
					- While “[rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling) = rotation + translation”, “sprolling = winding + translation”
					- The slang “[sproll](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sproll)” can be “spin + roll” or “spam + troll”.

			- For a single loop ➰ and when it degenerates into just a (soliton) wave packet, its motion is the combination between the "propagation" in the direction of the the main thread and the "curling in & out" of the loop/packet.
			- In general, there are 3 parts of this movement: thread input, rotating inside, and thread output.
				- In Unithread view, all [bodies](((66c810a0-9861-4787-bdcf-1378219332be))) in the worlds, from celestial bodies, organisms (thread = food & info), to simple physical objects (thread = energy), are "living" (existing) by this movement. The difference is just how complicated the "rotation" inside that body is.
				- I think “**transcycling** = cycling + translation” should be an apt term for this general movement.
					- “transcycling = cycling + exchange (I/O)”: the bicycle cycling, itself, includes the translation of the bicycle and the exchange of momentum, but i add the prefix “trans” to stress the intrinsic exchange of content, transition of state, transformation of thread.
					- About the verb “to ((687743fd-9d45-45be-b9fd-3055cbb8a938))”: When an obop transcycles *on/along* the thread from left to right, it transcycles the thread through its body and effectively makes the thread move from right to left relative to the obop.

					- “turn” ~ “rotate”: in maths, “turn = cycle” like “[turn of rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(knot)) = round loop of rope”, “[1 turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle)) = 1 cycle” 1τ = 2π

			- The mechanism of this unmixing is the same as the interunion, only reverse in direction of the effect flows: from the product back to intent circles
				- This symmetry is the nature of the interunion operation: (x, y) -> (x', y') has 2 families of cones: mixing cones (x, y) -> x'; (x, y) -> y'; and unmixing cones x -> (x', y'); y -> (x', y').
