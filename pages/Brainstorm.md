			- I'm discussing with Copilot, but the right image is blocked because it's "too sensitive!" 😯😧
			  collapsed:: true
				- Maybe it looks like a crotch 🤔?!
				- I just want to make it clear that the circle is a loop ➰, not separate from the thread.
			- Copilot suggests "spooling" & "entwining".
			  collapsed:: true
				- While "entwining" is good for its broad sense, "spooling" is good for its common usage in computing and capturing both "spooling in" and "spooling out".
				- For a thick coil with many loops in between, "spooling" is a great term which can be combined with "rolling": at the two ends, the thread is "spooled in/out", while in between, it just rolls/rotates around.
				- I'm thinking of the new term “spool-rolling” or “sprolling” /sprol.ɪŋ/ to combine “spooling” & “rolling”!
					- While “[rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling) = rotation + translation”, “sprolling = winding + translation”
					- The slang “[sproll](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sproll)” can be “spin + roll” or “spam + troll”.
					- Don't be confused with “sprawling” /sprɔːl.ɪŋ/
					- Related to the hot “rolling spool”.
						- [Rolling and pulling](https://leancrew.com/all-this/2023/06/rolling-and-pulling/)
						- [The surprising rolling spool: Experiments and theory from mechanics to phase transitions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264161700_The_surprising_rolling_spool_Experiments_and_theory_from_mechanics_to_phase_transitions) with [PDF](../assets/physics/Surprising-EJP09JunRev.pdf)
			- For a single loop ➰ and when it degenerates into just a (soliton) wave packet, its motion is the combination between the "propagation" in the direction of the the main thread and the "curling in & out" of the loop/packet.
			- In general, there are 3 parts of this movement: thread input, rotating inside, and thread output.
				- In Unithread view, all [bodies](((66c810a0-9861-4787-bdcf-1378219332be))) in the worlds, from celestial bodies, organisms (thread = food & info), to simple physical objects (thread = energy), are "living" (existing) by this movement. The difference is just how complicated the "rotation" inside that body is.
				- I think “**transcycling** = cycling + translation” should be an apt term for this general movement.
					- “transcycling = cycling + exchange (I/O)”: the bicycle cycling itself includes the translation of the bicycle and the exchange of momentum, but i add the prefix “trans” to stress the intrinsic exchange of content, transition of state, transformation of thread.
					- Verb “to transcycle”: When an obop transcycles *on* the thread from left to right
				- “transcycling” is close to “traversal”, with “cycle” ~ “verse = turn”!
					- ((678b72d3-073a-4763-a49f-5233a3d86614))
					- The “turn” in “traversal” is the change (nearly reverse) of direction in the zigzag course or switchback: to exhaustively traverse a flat space, we must switchback many times.
						- A milder “turn” is the “turn away” (nearly perpendicularly) from the main direction of the flow/river/road to **cross over** it, i.e. the original meaning of the Latin verb “[traversare](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/traversare)”.
					- “turn” ~ “rotate”: in maths, “turn = cycle” like “[turn of rope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(knot)) = round loop of rope”, “[1 turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(angle)) = 1 cycle” 1τ = 2π
		- [pipe wrapping](((670cdcb4-3c85-45af-8c30-3c3284ed37df))) = signal piping = message conveyance

			- "pipe" over "tube, cylinder": the axis is indefinitely long and it's also used for signal/message conveyance.
			- Thread of N distributions of marks (via pipe wrapping of N subthreads) = N-dim function = function derivable in N levels (through pipe wrapping) to straight line = motion in N-dim space = N particles in 1D space
				- wrap up to N-dim box = SCIFER of N sustents
					- Acceleration via changing the order of sustents
				- N-level extension = linearization of N-dim curve to straight line, so that it can be piped through pipe wrapping
					- Thread linearization = digital serialization
				- 3rd law of Newton shown on relative distributions of 2 threads on the pipe
			- The same meaning/image form different roots:
			  “Both North & South poles are just two ends of the axis pole!”
				- "pole" & "whole"  from old English "pal" & "hal" 
				  vs
				- "pole" & "holo-" form Greek "polos" & "holos"!
				- Is there some relationship here?!
