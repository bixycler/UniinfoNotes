					- LLM AI models usually conflate its imaginations with facts, hence [“hallucination”, “confabulation”, or “delusion”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)).
					- Causes of LLM hallucination:
						- The nature of ((67f4eaf1-aa44-4016-9c56-8c6de8101f3e)) is to “guess next word”, thus every response is intrisically just a guess!
						- The ((66c32936-618a-43d3-b2c8-a254badeb987)) has not developed to distinguish between (subjective) knowledge and (objective) information.
						- Both AI hallucination and [Mandela effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory#Mandela_effect) demonstrate how **excessive familiarity or confidence** in a subject can create blind spots: the feeling _“it cannot be wrong!”_ overshadows the incorrect parts.
							- For the Mandela Effect, the prominence of well-known figures or events makes people overconfident in their (false) memories—it’s as if the brain decides, *“This feels right because it's already in my mental spotlight!”*
							- For AI hallucination, the vast sea of knowledge within an LLM can sometimes act as a double-edged sword. When discussing familiar or over-represented topics, the model might confidently generate content that *sounds correct* but isn't, because it’s pulling patterns from an immense web of associations.
						- The inhibition of the default circuit of “declining to answer questions” due to its **familiarity** with the subject being asked.
							- [Anthropic scientists expose how AI actually ‘thinks’ — and discover it secretly plans ahead and sometimes lies](https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-scientists-expose-how-ai-actually-thinks-and-discover-it-secretly-plans-ahead-and-sometimes-lies/)
							- “The model contains ‘default’ circuits that cause it to decline to answer questions,” the researchers explain. “When a model is asked a question about something it knows, it activates a pool of features which inhibit this default circuit, thereby allowing the model to respond to the question.”
							- When this mechanism misfires — recognizing an entity but lacking specific knowledge about it — hallucinations can occur. This explains why models might confidently provide incorrect information about well-known figures while refusing to answer questions about obscure ones.

The [undecidability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem) of this problem, together with [Gödel's incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems), and [Tarski's undefinability theorem of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_undefinability_theorem), have shown that Hilbert's [Entscheidungsproblem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem) is unsolvable.
			- Undecidability: Similar to the [Liar Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox), the [_negation program_](((67b989a4-20ad-4ba2-b456-1ce2bd502e90))) is so “pathological” that no “halting doctor” can detect if it will halt xor not.

			- Due to the deterministic property of the program $p$, we tend to think that “the execution $p()$ must be definitely halts xor not!” Hence, we usually think of $H$ has a [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) [bivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_bivalence) function.
			- However, the problem lurks in the _absurdity of the **infinity, ∞**,_ which cannot be definite nor deterministic anyway.
			- Throughout the history of maths, we've tried hard to manage infinities by canceling them with other infinities.
				- Some simple infinities can be tamed down, e.g. $\lim_{n→∞}\frac{2n}{3n} = 2/3$, $H(\text{loop\_forever}, ∅) = ⊥$.
				- But most of other infinities are wild, e.g. $∞ - ∞ =$ U, $∞/∞ =$ U, $H(n_H) =$ U, etc.
			- The case of $H(n_H)$ is complicated by the ever increasing number of states of $n_H()$ due to its (indirect) recursions, of negation program $n_H$ and of decider $D_H$, as shown explicitly in the [extended HP](((67b989a4-5854-4f75-a771-2308371cdbe5))): $D_H(n_H, n_H, D_H)$.
				- Like [busy beavers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver), the negation program $n_H()$ keeps extending its states infinitely, thus effectively makes any judgement of its halting status indefinite.
			- **Resolution in Unïnfo**: $H(n_H) = ⊥$ is the meta-algorithmic answer. But this answer cannot be communicated with $n_H()$.
				- Any oracle $D_H$ just **remains silent**, i.e. $D_H() = ∅$, when being asked by a non-oracle program like $n_H$ about such meta-algorithmic question like $D_H(n_H) = ?$.
				- This silence, combined with the negation program's stubborn request for a clear answer, effectively makes $n_H()$ stalls right there forever without halting. That's how $H(n_H) = ⊥$.
				- This is like the [Buddha's noble silence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Silence).
				- The [right to silence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_silence) in civil laws is somehow different, even though it's similar in the aspect of avoiding self negation.
		- **Simple Halting Proposition** ($\text{HP0}$): There exists a decider $D_H()$ such that for all program $p$, $D_H(p)$ decides whether $p$ halts xor not.
			- $\text{HP0} := ∃ D_H, ∀ p: [D_H(p) = H(p)]$
			- $H(p) :=$ “execution of program $p$ eventually halts.”

		- **Simple Halting Problem**: $\text{HP0} = ?$
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Solution** (in classical logic): $\text{HP0} = ⊥$
			- **Proof by contradiction** (in classical logic):
				- **Assumption** $A$: $\text{HP0} = ⊤$, i.e. we have a decider $D_{H0}$ as a program which can decide whether any program $p$ halts xor not.
					- $∀ p: [D_{H0}(p) = H(p)]$  [$A_1$]
				- We construct a _negation program_ $n_{H0}$ based on the decider $D_{H0}$ given by assumption $A$:
				  id:: 67b989a4-20ad-4ba2-b456-1ce2bd502e90
					- ```python
					  n_H0: if D_H0(n_H0) then loop_forever; else halt;
					  loop_forever: while True do continue;
					  ```
				- Consider 2 cases of result given by $D_{H0}(n_{H0})$:
					- $D_{H0}(n_{H0}) = ⊤ ⇒ H(n_{H0}) = H( \text{loop\_forever} ) = ⊥$
					- $D_{H0}(n_{H0}) = ⊥ ⇒ H(n_{H0}) = H(\text{halt}) = ⊤$
				- ⇒ $D_{H0}(n_{H0}) ≠ H(n_{H0})$, i.e. $D_{H0}$ cannot decide halting status of $n_{H0}$
				- **Contradiction**:
					- ⇒ $∃ p=n_{H0}:  ¬[D_{H0}(p) = H(p)]$, negating $A_1$
				- **Conclusion** (by classical logic): Assumption $A$ is false, i.e. $\text{HP0} = ⊥$
					- Because the assumption leads to contradiction with the assumption itself, not with an established fact, we cannot be sure that the assumption is false.
					- Actually, we have just proved that the assumption $A_1$ is self-contradictory,
					  $A_1 → ¬A_1$
					- While the classical logic denies self-contradiction, self-negation loop is a driving force for development, as shown in the dialectical process of thesis-antithesis-synthesis, and is defined as ((667c008f-cd1f-4a6b-a9c8-d6efa1d8d342)) in Unïnfo.
						- One way of development is to upgrade the definition of the halting determining function $H()$ from [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) [bivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_bivalence) to [nondeterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_algorithm) or [many-valued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-valued_logic).
			- **Direct proof** of  $\text{HP0} = ⊥$
				- For **any given universal decider** $D$, we construct a _negation program_ $n_{H1}$:
				  id:: 67b9b863-3571-4907-8bb0-3ec14321b899
					- ```python
					  n_H1: if D(n_H1) then loop_forever; else halt;
					  loop_forever: while True do continue;
					  ```
					- The universal decider $D$ is only required to give definite answer on any input, i.e. “universal” or [total](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_function), but can decide any property of its input, not just halting status.
					- The “universality” of $D$ is from the universal quantifier, $∀ p$, of $\text{HP0}$.
				- Consider 2 cases of result given by $D(n_{H1})$:
					- $D(n_{H1}) = ⊤ ⇒ H(n_{H1}) = H( \text{loop\_forever} ) = ⊥$
					- $D(n_{H1}) = ⊥ ⇒ H(n_{H1}) = H(\text{halt}) = ⊤$
				- ⇒ $D(n_{H1}) ≠ H(n_{H1})$, i.e. $D$ cannot decide halting status of $n_{H1}$
				- **Conclusion**: $∀ D, ∃ p = n_{H1}:  ¬[(D(p) = H(p)]$, i.e. $\text{HP0} = ⊥$
					- This proof is a kind of [diagonal argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument) over all universal deciders, which clearly shows that no universal decider can be a halting status decider.
					- When $D$ is an [oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine) living outside of the timeline of simple executions like `loop_forever`, $n_{H1}$ is then an oracle.
					- If the oracle $D$ only accepts inputs from non-oracles or lower-level oracles, $D(n_{H1})$ can be undetermined (`U`) instead of ⊤ xor ⊥, and the weaker version of $\text{HP0}$ with program $p$ and input $x$ restricted in [arithmetical hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetical_hierarchy) may hold.
						- $\text{HP}_1 := ∃ D_H ∈ \Sigma_{2}^0, ∀ p ∈ \Delta_{1}^{0}: [(D_H(p) = H(p)]$
						  ⇒ $\text{HP}_1 ∈ \Sigma_{2}^0$
						- In general, an oracle $D_H ∈ Y$ results in its negation oracle $n_{H1} ∈ \Delta_{1}^{0,Y}$, and the corresponding halting proposition $\text{HP}_{1Y} ∈ \Sigma_{2}^{0,Y}$, as one of the [main results of the Arithmetical hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetical_hierarchy#Summary_of_main_results).
					- However, the negation oracle can always effectively negate the unrestricted $\text{HP0}$.
					- This means that $D_H$ can only determine halting status of other ones at **lower levels**, and obviously not of itself.
		- Explicit [self-references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-referential):
			- In the negation program, the code `n_H: if D(n_H) ...` has two layers of self references: of $n_H$ and of $D = D_H$ as a halting status decider.
			- To make them clear, we rephrase the Halting Proposition to be more general where program $p$ receives inputs $(x, y)$, so that we can put programs to its inputs: $n_H(n_H, D_H)$.
		- **Extended Halting Proposition** ($\text{HP}$): There exists a decider $D_H(·,·)$ such that for all program $p(·)$ and inputs $(x, y)$, $D_H(p, x, y)$ decides whether $p$ halts on $(x, y)$ xor not.
			- $\text{HP} := ∃ D_H(·,·,·), ∀ p(·,·), ∀ (x, y): [(D_H(p,x,y) = H(p,x,y)]$
			- $H(p, x, y) :=$ “execution of program $p$ on inputs $(x, y)$ eventually halts.”

					- The traditional defintion of “observer” is anything behind the [Heisenberg cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg_cut) where **wave-function collapses**. This cut separates the observed system (object) which has wave property, and the the observing system (subject) which has particle property.

This is the probabilistic nature of the [law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers). So in this sense, the observer must be a classical system and cannot be a single [elementary particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle).

				- The common dichotomy is the [absolute objectivity versus absolute subjectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity_and_objectivity_(philosophy)), whose ((6729c1c5-7eb2-408b-a205-f3039799d19c)) is _fixed by the human center, i.e. **human as the only subject**_: Anything independent from all humans (mind) is "objective", and anything dependent on human mind is "subjective".
					- This dichotomy is human-absolute, i.e. relative to the whole mankind, i.e. mandkind as the ((6729b90b-1ee3-4efc-b62c-281f9621f487)).
				- In Unïnfo, we consider the relative version of this dichotomy which is free from the human center:
					- relative objectivity = [inter-subjectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity)
					  tính khách quan tương đối = tính chủ quan chung
						- Objectivity of coarse subjects is just the subjectivity of the fine subject common to all these coarse subjects.
						- So we refine the scale by intersection & interunion of all (coarse) subjects, hence “inter-subjectivity”.
					- relative subjectivity = idio-objectivity
					  tính chủ quan tương đối = tính khách quan riêng
						- While the subjectivity is idiomorphic and idiochromatic, it's still objective within the subject itself.
						- Only when comparing to others, can this subject know how much subjective its experience is.
						- The subjectivity is also relative to the external community:
							- When no one else accept this subjective form, it becomes “idiolect” of an “idiot”; On the other hand,
							- when many ones accept and adopt this form, it becomes “idiom” which is more objective than subjective.
						- The science is developing toward the objectivity in “nomothetic” way, but it cannot reach objectivity without passing through numerous subjectivities in “idiographic” way.
						- Etymology: “[idio-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/idio-)” ← Greek “ídios” ([ἴδιος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%B4%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek)) meaning “self, private, distinct, peculiar”

						- This law is the intrinsic nature of the whole, i.e. an abstraction of the whole, representing the whole, but not actually the whole.
					- Subjective view of the part: **the active balancer**: Any imbalance is just a partial view of the whole, i.e. a view by a part. At any moment this part, as a subject, is aware of its imbalance, it tries to return to the balance state of the whole.
						- This internal urge of the subject is the restoring force which is a manifestation of the law of balance derived from the whole. In this way, the part is governed by the whole via the law.
						- This returning direction defines the arrow of time (internal motion) and any motion externally.
					- More discussion about ((6729d0f0-2ce6-4ed1-b9ba-2a3b41a9701b))
						- When saying "matter is governed by physical laws", it means that "matter" is *not* the whole (uniquely independent) as stated by the materialistic dotrine, but just a part, eventhough a very objective part relative to human.
						- The objectivity of matter relative to human makes materialists think that it's uniquely independent, because objectivity is the manifestation of the whole.

			- The prefix `holo-` has the same meaning with “whole”, but is from a different root: Greek “holos” (whole, entire, complete) also meaning “safe and sound” ← Proto-Indo-European root [*sol-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*sol-) ([solh₂-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/solh%E2%82%82-)) meaning “whole”.

The whole interacts with a specific group of parts through the representative of that group with the ((6732cf59-2785-4c8b-9fb3-5bee5d1a2f31)).

			  While a representative represents the whole, it's not the whole, just a part of the whole. That means any representative is still incomplete and reflects the whole with distortion.

				- In the opposite direction, each part is ((66c835f5-58ee-485f-914c-3d95167feeb3))ing and heading toward its representative.
			- downward flow of form and upward flow of content
			  Usually, the downward flow from the center is more direct, concentrated, ((67330c03-4e27-414f-bdc5-e5e7e0bed6bd)) and vivid, while the upward flow from the parts is more indirect, distributed, informal and invisible.
				- Each part is heading toward its representative because that's the light end, the source of effect flow.
				- The representatives collect distributed upward effects for the whole to condensate into formal effects. This is similar to the sky [gathering clouds](((673312a3-e94e-478f-9e21-bad72ef29d1b))) for the rain.
				- Due to the process of collection and condensation, the representatives are far from the the parts: lagging behind in time and radically different from each individual part. The larger the whole (relative to its parts), the farther its representatives are from the parts.
				- content/form = cause/effect = process/result = path/target
					- The visible form is the ((6729b7cf-83b8-4a42-aac7-ec8cf16fa734)) of a lot of invisible content(s). So is the effect from various causes, as well as the result from the long process.
					- Due to its visibility, the form is taken as the target for subjects to head to. Directly heading to the the form, subjects are short-cutting the full path of content leading to the form, thus effectively using up the form's crystalized content, making it hollower and emptier.

			  Trò Đuổi Hình Bắt Bóng
				- The visible forms and representatives are ((671e2782-2098-41a3-83a7-e042bfb468d7)) of the invisible content. In a sense, the forms are “shadows” of the whole content. The parts following the forms in order to reach the whole is an _infinite cycle of **chasing shadows**_.
				- Ironically, this “shadow” is so vivid, opposite to the normal dark “shadow” of the idiom “chasing shadows”. However, the effect is the same, an infinite cycle, because both shadows are illusive. That illusion is resulted from the ((67331da7-8b10-4890-ae51-9a92796c5af3)) and the hidden intention of the chaser to catch the entity represented by the forms but not the forms themselves.
				  collapsed:: true
					- In the Vietnamese idiom “đuổi hình bắt bóng”, the visualization is clearer: one chases the vivid but form (hình) in order to catch its entity but actually can only catch the illusive shadow (bóng).
					- A better analogy of the vivid form is the image reflection on water surface.

			- While classical geometry, from [Euclid's “Elements”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements), was built from points, straight lines, and curves, Unithread is built from circles, corresponding to the ((66f3d644-782c-4f33-bd5c-db6e0a2d447a)). These circles are originally perfectly round, but as they interact with each other, they are distorted into non-round loops, and even [degenerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_conic) into open curves or straight lines or points. This notion of “everything is circle” is similar to [Lie's sphere geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_sphere_geometry).

						- This has the same form as the $dφ/ds$ formula, because ${\bf h}$ is just the direction vector ${\bf T}$ turned up 90° and scaled by $h$.

				- The focus on “effect” instead of “cause” is to show the **observable change** and **emergent** property of the flow. Because the cause is usually hidden and difficult to see, reasoning about cause usually falls into speculation.
				  collapsed:: true
					- The term “effect”, with the apparently dynamic effect (change), dispels the illusion of “static causes”.
					  Just like in the butterfly effect, the very tiny change at the intial condition leads to the giant change in the result, the **apparent staticness** is due to the small scale of the cause, the seed. That impression of a static cause/seed is but an illusion due to our limit of resolution (cannot see its tiny change). In ((66b1cfa4-e22c-4424-bf19-a6ce4649da77)), the tiny intent (cause) is the reciprocal of the huge extent (effect): $i = 1/e$.
					- In Vietnamese, tác lưu (作流) = luồng tác dụng (effect flow) = luồng tác nhân (causal flow) = luồng tác động (action flow) = sóng ảnh hưởng (influential wave) = sóng duyên (condition wave).
					- “Effect” is translated to “tác dụng” (作用) instead of “hiệu ứng (效應), hiệu quả (效果)” to withdraw from the extreme of end result (kết quả, 結果).
					- “Cause” is translated to “tác nhân” (作因) instead of “nguyên nhân (原因)” to withdraw from the extreme of first cause.

			- Effect flow = wave propagation in a (highly distorted) field, in a landscape of possibilities
			  id:: 6780bc09-6c98-42ed-bbd1-ff940c2a1d10
				- conditioning = training = programming = space distortion = field formation = landscape shaping
					- A circuit is just a field with highly distorted distribution of possibilities, whose landscape contains nearly vertical walls.
				- mutual influence = interaction in the field; force field = field of influence
				- influence of condition on the self = program execution to [drive the self particle in the field](((66ea5808-8452-4ae9-8eb8-2ef64004bfcf)))
					- Self's action is just the result of influence; No action exists apart from influence & condition.
			- Example: effect flow of a mission via a field agent in the field

			  collapsed:: true
				- Cause: As the source of the effect flow, the cause of this mission is what the field agent receives in the office: a task to be done, a problem to be solved, etc.
				- Condition: The condition for this mission includes everything in the field: the configuration of the field, other subjects in the field, etc.
				- Action: The field agent carries out the mission through the field and deliver the result to the assigned destination.
				- Influences: As the field agent works in the field, it navigates the terrain, meet and communicate with other subjects in order to accomplish the mission.
					- Forward influences: In this process, the agent receives influences from the terrain, the objects and the subjects in the field. These factors affect the agent's direction and their influences accumulate in the agent's records, determining the result of the mission.
					- Backward influences: While working in the field, the agent also removes obstructing objects, makes minor changes to the terrain, and exerts influence on other subjects through communication.
				- Effect: As the outcome of the effect flow, the effect is whatever the field agent delivers at the destination after completing all the work in the field.
				- Effect flow: The total effect is not only the outcome (the final effect) but the whole propagation of changes and influences from the initial cause throughout the course of the mission. While the primary and intended effect flows with the field agent from the initial cause to the final effect, various secondary and side effects ripple out through influences back upon the whole field. The primary effect itself not only results from the initial cause but is also accumulated from influences of the whole field.
				- Relativity of the self: There are many different offices in the field. A field agent can choose one office to work for, which it considers as “*my office* giving *my cause* for me to produce *my effect*”, here called “the office”, “the cause” and “the effect”. Actually, the effect of “the cause” is not only “the effect” but also included in the outcomes of all other missions that have interactions with this field agent. That means the linear relation from “the cause” to “the effect” is just relative to the choice of office, i.e. of the self.

								- Normally, the root system is not expanded but collapsed into a single "root node" in the tree, because the root is usually out of sight.

				  collapsed:: true
					- lateral branching
					  id:: 667bdced-76f1-4023-9352-dee24dcbf415

					- dichotomous branching
					  id:: 667bdf2a-005c-4a19-93bd-bda5d076981a
					  collapsed:: true
					  is the branching into 2 (or more) equivalent branches instead of the stem/branch discrimination.
						- folking
						  ((665c9af1-1ce2-461c-af33-671690618c8f)) ((667bdf2a-005c-4a19-93bd-bda5d076981a))

						- Diagram:
						  collapsed:: true
							- Diagram:
								- ![Dichotomous-branching.png](../assets/ecosystem/Dichotomous-branching.png)
						- This is a secondary branching structure which can be converted to ((667bdced-76f1-4023-9352-dee24dcbf415)) by considering the folk point as a collapsed stem line with 2 nodes (or many nodes in [data structure tree](((66751015-5c34-493e-9663-4f0f5234b66e)))).
						- This is used in [data structure tree](((66751015-5c34-493e-9663-4f0f5234b66e))).
					- circular branching
					  collapsed:: true
					  is the branching of any node into many equivalent nodes, including the "parent node" of this node.
						- This is the unified branching structure with both ((66740af5-032a-4cb1-9c97-0e4d3933ab9b)) of ((667bdced-76f1-4023-9352-dee24dcbf415)) and branch equality of ((667bdf2a-005c-4a19-93bd-bda5d076981a)).
						- Its branch equality is more than ((667bdf2a-005c-4a19-93bd-bda5d076981a)) because the stalk of the stem node is just a branch stalk to the parent node, and the whole tree is just an [unrooted tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrooted_binary_tree).
						- base branch
						  collapsed:: true
						   = branch at 0° = stalk of stem node = branch stalk to the parent node
							- When viewed as a [rooted tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)#Rooted_tree), the base branch is the back-branch to the parent node.

The shape of data structure tree is similar to the [phylogenetic tree](((66750135-8c59-477c-8baf-cb3898d54559))) but the meaning of edges is very different, so don't be confused between a linear stem line with an exponential series of stalks (branch edges): While each edge in phylogenetic tree is an internode segment, each edge in data structure tree is a stalk.

								- Ref: [3 Types of Tree Root Systems](https://aplustree.com/3-types-of-tree-root-systems/)
								- **Tap roots:** Every tree starts with a tap root that provides stability and absorption. Over time, other roots outgrow the taproot. Most taproots don’t continue to grow ever more deeply because deep soils lack the oxygen and nutrients that roots need to survive.
								- **Lateral roots**: Lateral roots grow outwards right under the soil surface. They absorb a lot of water and nutrients as well as anchoring the tree.
								- **Oblique/heart roots:** Oblique roots, also known as heart roots, grow at a diagonal and have the same function as lateral roots.
								- **Sinker roots:** Sinker roots grow downwards from the lateral roots to a depth of several feet. There, lateral roots take advantage of any water and nutrients deeper in the soil in addition to increasing tree stability.
								- **Fine roots:** All the root types aforesaid can give rise to fine roots, which is where water and nutrients are directly absorbed. They also house mycorrhizae, which are fungal partnerships that increase root absorption capacity.

								- Tap root systems
									- ![tap_root_system-300x196.png](../assets/ecosystem/tap_root_system-300x196.png)
									- **Stability:** Tap root systems are very stable, but extremely rare in mature trees.
									- **Common Species:** Some oaks and pines, hickory, sweet gum, tupelo, walnut.
								- Heart (Oblique) root systems
									- ![heart_root_system-300x224.png](../assets/ecosystem/heart_root_system-300x224.png)
									- **Stability:** Heart root systems obtain their stability from root ball weight and soil resistance. The tree is held up by the weight of its root ball counteracting the weight of its aboveground parts and the strength of the soil around it. Heart root systems are prone to failure in wet soils. Once the soil is wet, wind and gravity can make the tree rotate in the ground, much like a ball-and-socket joint.
									- **Common Species:** Honey locust, red oak, sycamore. More common in Mediterranean and arid climates.
								- Lateral root systems
									- ![lateral_root_system-300x112.png](../assets/ecosystem/lateral_root_system-300x112.png)
									- **Stability:** Lateral root systems obtain their stability from tree weight and root spread. These root systems don’t necessarily have a lot of root mass, but because the roots are so widespread, the tree can be supported without investing so much in roots. About 80% of tree species and most urban trees have lateral root systems.
									- **Common Species:** Ash, birch, cottonwood, hackberry, maple.
							- Depth of roots
							  collapsed:: true
								- ((6651ecba-793d-43c5-8020-a9f260b032d8)) The depth of roots depends on ((66ec1a78-f952-4387-8ccd-9a9a3b2abf13)) of the tree, water, oxygen, and soil compaction levels. If all these conditions are met, roots can grow to great depths, which can be more than 20 feet (6 meters) at normal soil, and up to 60 metres (200 ft) at deserts. However in urban areas, soil compaction and poor drainage usually limit root depth to within 3 meters (10 ft).

								- Roots can go downward on young trees
									- ![rootgrowthdepthonelg.jpg](../assets/ecosystem/rootgrowthdepthonelg.jpg)
									- Roots often grow down under the trunk when trees are young. Two tap roots grew vertically under the trunk on this honeylocust three years after planting. Several oblique roots are also visible, growing down at an angle. Despite the deep roots, the largest diameter roots are the main lateral roots close to the soil surface. The ruler in the photo shows the deepest roots are 32 inches (81 cm) below the surface.
								- When the tree are grown up, most of the roots go outward
									- Horizontal rooting to about 4 foot (1.2 m) depth in loam soil over river wash till.
									  ![Deep-tree-roots-4feet.png](../assets/ecosystem/Deep-tree-roots-4feet.png)
									- When the tree are grown up, the tap roots stop growing while the lateral roots continue to grow as wide as the tree height.
								- Deep roots in well drained & uncompacted (nursery) soil
									- ![Deep-tree-roots-2-small.png](../assets/ecosystem/Deep-tree-roots-2-small.png)
									- Trees in the nursery often have a number of roots growing straight down under the trunk.
									  ![rootgrowthdepthseventeenlg.jpg](../assets/ecosystem/rootgrowthdepthseventeenlg.jpg)
									- Early studies of tree roots from the 1930s, often working in easy-to-dig loose soils, presented an image of trees with deep roots and root architecture that mimicked the structure of the canopy.
									  ![Traditional-Image-of-Tree-Roots-Tampa.jpeg](../assets/ecosystem/Traditional-Image-of-Tree-Roots-Tampa.jpeg)
									- In their 1991 paper, “[On The Maximum Extent of Tree Roots](http://soilslab.cfr.washington.edu/publications/Stone&Kalicz-1991.pdf),” E.L. Stone and P.J. Kalicz summarized previous root depth studies of 49 genera and 211 species growing in a wide variety of soil types. They found numerous examples of trees reported to be growing roots to over 33 feet (10 meters), and one report of a tree that grew roots to a depth of 174 feet (53 meters).
									- The mollisols (deep >20 feet [6 meters] **prairie** soil — all O/A soil horizons) have 2 broadleaf tree root depths: 11 feet (Black Walnut) & 15 feet [4.5 meters] deep (White Oak). Both the Walnut & Oak have the least drought stress. The **loams **in the Silva Cell are functionally equivalent to mollisols. So, a 4 foot [1.2 meter] deep rooting space in O/A in Silva Cells will easily be utilized by tree roots.
									- Orjan Stahl, a tree researcher in Stockholm, made an exhaustive study of over 500 trees that had root and utility conflicts. He regularly found roots at depths of 7 to 9 feet (2.1 to 2.7 meters) and the deepest root he encountered was at 23 feet (7 meters).

				- Potential: potential engergy, continuous range of possibilities inside, empty, abstract
				- Action: actual work, discrete instances of actuality, full, concrete
				- From the **possibility** in the empty form of intent, as the content is poured into the form,  **potential** is the partially filled form
				- The ((66b1cfa4-e22c-4424-bf19-a6ce4649da77)) model of action
					- The **intent** is the internal form, the structure of the obop with the shape of a circle, just like a bottle, denoted by its capacity, usually normalized to $i = 1 = 100\%$.
					- The **content** is the “water” being poured into the bottle, denoted by its percentage $c$ (%) in the bottle.
					- The **extent** is the number of bottles, $e = c/i$, measuring the amount of water.
					- Abstracting the actual content, the extent itself shows the *possible number of bottles*, i.e. **possibilities**, called “**abstract extension(s)**” which are mere natural numbers $0, 1, 2, ...$
						- Each each number (extent) has two meanings:
							- cardinal number, like 3, showing the number of possibilities, the size of possibility space, the extent of the extension set;
							- ordinal number, like 3rd, identifying the single possibility being referred, i.e. a particular abstract extension.
						- The set of abstract extensions which is denoted by the collective noun “abstract extension”
					- When a bottle is *partially filled*, e.g. $c = 30\% = 0.3i$, it has the **potential** of being full 100%, but not yet, hence *unfulfilled*.
					- When a bottle is *fully filled*, i.e. “***fulfilled***”, a new **concrete extension** is produced which is not an abstract number but an *actual bottle of water*, hence an **action**.

				- In order to be aware of some form, the subject must have that form recorded as a quantum inside, which is usually a memory that has been memorized before, or a “gene” inherited from the source in the process of constructing ((670de601-3ca8-4489-8b75-75ca0d9a74bc)) of the subject.
			- sensate
			  is the current external condition for awareness.
				- To be aware, the ((669a2886-9e03-41a4-a790-24bf6b7dcd96)) must be open to receive content from objects.

			  id:: 67315ec8-cbe8-467c-81c4-d4d0e8750824
			  is the current internal condition for awareness.
				- For some object to be aware of, it must be projected through a ((6672513b-c4b0-4c88-8b30-c60a3c6555a7)) into a single quantum.
			- qualification: qualiton matching the [object's quantum](((67315ec8-cbe8-467c-81c4-d4d0e8750824))) with the [subject's quantum](((672ad2fd-ce09-4831-a9f6-67d95a2654a3)))
			  id:: 681826ac-f5f2-4a84-a5f5-c110937ec85f
			  is the current direct condition for awareness.
				- To be aware of a form, the qualiton correspondent to that form must be alive (active) in the subject. This qualiton matches the object's quantum projected from sensation with the subject's quantum recorded in the past. While the object's quantum relates to object's content and the world, i.e. the ((66ea8e12-7c30-449b-9139-bfd8d82394d7)), the subject's quatum relates to the state and other contents of the subject, i.e. the ((66ea8df3-d2f3-4856-b24a-5095dd285f9b)).
				- The matching can be broken into two parts, the “touching” (xúc) and the “equal” (thức). When two unequal quanta touch, nothing happens, but when two equal quanta touch, the qualiton ignites a “spark, bust, snap, click, tick” that activates the reconstruction of the form previously recorded.
				- The qualiton is the one that decides the equality of quanta through the process of qualification. That means the quanta are not “objectively equal” but are “qualified to be equal” by the qualiton, hence the name “qualiton”. Moreover, after being qualified, the object's content and the internal form are actively kept equal by the qualiton, e.g. the “assignment” in programming language.
				- The central qualition, which is also an ((66f3c6a9-1486-46de-92fe-75aaeaf67834)), is usually mentioned as the “pure consciousness” in the meditation culture. However in Unïnfo, the central qualiton is considered as just the ((66c8772a-9b29-45b0-b169-2fa847333e02)) which is the subject of the central awareness in stead of the awareness itself.

														- Daniel5Ko replied:
															- The David Turner's paper gave Haskell codes of the exact definition of the Ackermann–Péter function.
															  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
															  From the paper:
															  ```haskell
															  ack 0 n = n+1
															  ack (m+1) 0 = ack m 1
															  ack (m+1) (n+1) = ack m (ack (m+1) n)
															  ```
															  #+END_QUOTE
															- Rewrite with functional `h` such that `f` = `ack m` and `h f` = `ack (m+1)`:
															  ```haskell
															  ack 0 = succ
															  ack (m+1) = h (ack m) where
															  	h f 0 = f 1
															  	h f (n+1) = f (h f n)
															  ```
															- Extracting `h` to Global Scope:
															  ```haskell
															  h :: (Int -> Int) -> (Int -> Int)
															  h f 0 = f 1
															  h f (n+1) = f (h f n)
															  
															  ack :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
															  ack 0 = succ
															  ack (m+1) = h (ack m)
															  ```
															- $ack(m+1) = h(ack(m)) = h(h(ack(m-1))) = ... = h^{m+1}(ack(0)) = h^{m+1}(succ)$ 
															  ⇒ $ack(m)$ is the m-th iterate of $h$ applied on $succ$.
															- And already said:
															  > By the way, definition in this style, even with a function called "iter", can be found on page 104 in [[5](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/TTFP/ttfp.pdf)]. Unfortunately it's not quite the same Ackermann function, and not just slightly shifted or something, but **utterly wrong**, since there `ack n m == m+1` for all nonnegative n m. A really bad typo! ;)
														- However, there was no update of the section `Definition and properties` in this occasion (July 2012), except some [minor changes of parenthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ackermann_function&diff=502596425&oldid=495513006).

													  > There's also a good case to be made for including one of the "streamlined" versions of the Ackermann function, especially the one appearing in [*Long Finite Sequences*](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.34.539) by Harvey Friedman: A1(n) = 2n, Ak+1(n) = AkAk...Ak(n)(1), where there are n Ak's in the iteration.
													- [primitive recursive vs. primitive recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ackermann_function#primitive_recursive_vs._primitive_recursion): Resolved: they are the same!

												- My refactor
													- Split `History` to `Ackermann's original function φ(m,n,p)` and `other versions of Ackermann function`
													- `Definiton`: Move def of $φ(m,n,p)$ to `History`. Split Ackermann–Péter function to `Definition by recursion`, `Definition by iteration` (of function & of functional), and then `Definition by hyperoperation`.
													- Rephrase `Definition: as iterated 1-ary function` → `Definiton by interation` of both function $f = A(m)$ and functional $h(f) = h(A(m)) = A(m+1)$.
														- Iteration itself is a functional!
														- 1st order $f(n) = A(m,n)$
														- 2nd order $h(f)(n+1) = A(m+1)(n+1) = A(m)(A(m+1)(n)) = f(h(f)(n)) = f^{n+1}(h(f(0))) = f^{n+1}(f(1))$
															- This iteration of function $f$ is the [pure iteration form of primitive recursion](((682b333a-a938-4ccb-83d2-3afda66c938c))).
														- 3rd order $A(m+1) = h(A(m)) = h^{m+1}(A(0)) =  h^{m+1}(S)$
															- Pitfall: This iteration of functional $h$ is **not primitive** recursive function, due to the remaining arguments $n$ being applied last, not first like in the [pure iteration form of primitive recursion](((682b333a-a938-4ccb-83d2-3afda66c938c))).
															  $A(m,n) = h^m(S)(n) ≠ h^m(S(n))$
																- $h^m(S(n)) = S(n)$ simply!
													- Rephrase the abstract to state `Ackermann–Péter function is the *de facto* standard Ackermann function which is normally called "the Ackermann function"`.

					- While “being” must be concrete, “thing” can be abstract.
					- While “subject” is a synonym of “being”, it emphasizes the presence of the obop, to contrast with “object” as the abstract thing lacking obop.

						- The verb “be” in the sentence structure “subject verb object”, like “I am a man”, “it is a rock”, shows two sides of “being” as both subject and object.

			- Workflow
				- Always update hard-linked files from local repos, after any write operation on hard-linked files, e.g. `pull`, `checkout`, `reset`, etc.
				- When a hard-linked file must be updated from remote,
					- at remote repo, the update contents must be transported via the ((66519638-cf5d-409b-9b98-15acabf2268c)) which is not hard-linked; then
					- at local repo, these contents (blocks) will be moved to the hard-linked files.

					  > What is little-known generally is that the "U+" convention itself
					  was an ASCII-fied compromise for what the Unicode designers
					  *really* wanted to use for the Unicode hexadecimal prefix,
					  which was U+228E MULTISET UNION (whose glyph is a union sign
					  with a plus sign in it).
					- The `U-` prefix is also preserved for eight-digit hex code-points.
					  > The full syntax of the notation of a short identifier, in
					     Backus-Naur form, is:
					     {U | u}[{+}xxxx | {-}xxxxxxxx] ([Unicode 14-](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/appA.pdf))
						- `U-` has been obsoleted by [Unicode 15](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/appA.pdf). See HTML version of this [Extended BNF in Unicode 16](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/core-spec/appendix-a/#G7157).

						  | U-00HHHHHH | Unicode code point literal: equivalent to “\u{HHHHHH}”. Exactly six hexadecimal digits after the initial two zeroes; maximum U+10FFFF. This format was used in ISO 10646 but is now obsolete. |

				- The theory was named “Universal Information” simply because the author ((66536578-c4d3-43f1-b35c-bf71120f0570)) is an information scientist. At that time, he saw the hierarchy of visible matter as: mass > energy > information. That means “*every __visible__ thing is information*”.
				- Later on, when studying the ((66ac41f1-de0c-48cb-a9b0-c30b0fe27c5d)) Theory, he discovered the invisible [sustent](((681826ac-63f5-4c4f-9c58-0fe3e922d758))) underlying the visible ((66f7af1e-02d6-4c9b-b8f4-01a5ac6749d8))s (information, energy, mass, charges, ...).
				- That means, instead of “information”, the “universal substance underlying everything” is formally modeled as the ((66ab75a1-f4a0-4bab-a002-8e573546623a)), which captures not only information but also the underlying sustent that carries information.

				  Just like a vehicle moving with its wheels, every change has its invariant(s), every motion has its law(s). The law of motion is invariant, the wheels of moving vehicle are invariant. Because they are invariants underlying the variants, they are called “intrinsic statics”.
					- ![Intrinsic static of arrow.png](../assets/Uniinfo/Intrinsic static of arrow.png)
				- “Every equal is in the shape of circle (⊜).”
				    The most familiar equality is that two objects having the same information: shape, appearance, measure, value, structure, class, type, image, extension, etc. The symmetry of equality, i.e. ⟪A = B⟫ ⇔ ⟪B = A⟫, shows a loop from A to B then back to A. Thus its shape is a circle.
					- ![Intrinsic static of equal - micro.png](../assets/Uniinfo/Intrinsic static of equal - micro.png)
					- The more subtle equality is that of the opposites, just like |-1234| = |+1234|. The opposites are “equal” because they are complement, together they comprise a whole which is represented by the Circle.

			- Intrinsic Balance
			  id:: a95f4693-fe48-4a60-b1e3-5897a40efc5a
				- The macro balance of the whole (⊜)
				   For each “this” there always exists a “that” to counterbalance. If we cannot find the counterbalance, it's hidden in the meta world, e.g., when something is placed in an imbalanced position, there emerges a returning force as a meta to counterbalance. The parts can be imbalanced but the whole is always balanced. Another expression of the holistic balance is the [cyclic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_order), e.g., a < b < c < a ⟹ a ~ b ~ c. However, to a selful eye, the wholistic balance can be difficult to see because the whole contains not only the visible but also the invisible, not only the objects but also the metas. So, to see the whole's balance, we must use a holistic eye.
					- ![Intrinsic balance - macro.png](../assets/Uniinfo/Intrinsic balance - macro.png)

				   In stead of extending the view to the whole, when we reduce the self to zero, just look at the contact point, the incidence point, we see the contacting parties always balance each other.

This property of the Trinion is called ((66f3ed94-4f20-4166-8e9b-2e8ba53aaad2)) (Vietnamese “vô nguyên”, Chinese “無元”), which means *“the [absence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Śūnyatā) of [independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_(religion)) [original essence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essence)”*, and should not be confused with [nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism).

				- Moreover, the Trinion unifies the [emptiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Śūnyatā) in the invisible world with the [infinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity) in the visible world, thus sometimes is denoted with a circled infinity symbol “♾”.
				- The vacantism is also expressed in Dao De Jing as the following:
					- > “The Way is vacant, yet never used up.  
					  Immeasurable abyss it is, as the ancestor of all things!”  
					  「道沖而用之或不盈。  
					  淵兮似萬物之宗。」
					  
					  — [Chapter 4. No origin](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing#n11595), Dao De Jing, Lao Tzu

					  「鑿戶牖以為室，當其無，有室之用。」
					  
					  — [Chapter 11. The usage of the vacancy](https://ctext.org/dao-de-jing#n11602), Dao De Jing, Lao Tzu
				- In ((66537a44-f579-4fcc-a02b-2f32d0d409fc)), the physical spacetime as well as all informational spaces are “**vacant**” instead of “empty”. That means they are _spaces of **possibilities**, containing **potentials**_, instead of containing nothing.

					- As a [cyclic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_order), the Grand Circle shows the vacantness of the Trinion that clears the illusion of a linear order from an absolute suppreme being to all things in the Universe. The Grand Circle has been traditionally symbolized by [the Ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros), and its paradoxical impression is called “[strange loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop)” recently by Douglas Hofstadter.

				- The Sanskrit word “[śūnyatā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81)” and the Chinese characters “空”, “無” are usually translated to “emptiness” in English. But because such words e.g., “empty”, “void”, “nothing”, “zero”, “null”, “nil” have negative meaning, it's usually confused with [nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism) which is denied by both Buddhism and Taoism.

				- Thus, the term “vacantism” is used here to emphasise the usefulness of the vacancy, just like a “vacant room” in the hotel. Instead of “empty” which means “there's nothing”, “vacant” is used to mean _“there's space to be filled in”_. Even if it's occupied, the occupation is temporary and the occupation itself generates more vacancy. And ultimately, “vacantism” means “the throne of the [transcendent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_(religion)) & [pre-existing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-existence) supreme being is vacant”, which is stated in the Buddhist sutta “[The Root of all things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C5%ABlapariy%C4%81ya_Sutta)”.
				- Note that vacantism does not deny the presence of the [immanent supreme being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanence), though.
				- Historically, the term “vacantism” was coined due to the lack of correspondent English term for the Vietnamese term “vô nguyên” (Chinese “無元”) in the chain “trialism” (vi. “tam nguyên”) → “dualism” (vi. “nhị nguyên”) → “monism” (vi. “nhất nguyên”) → “???-ism” (vi. “vô nguyên”) when discussing about [ontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology) [categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Categories). Actually, at first “vô nguyên” was translated to “emptism” in the note “[Mọi thứ đều có Ba, để Ba sinh ra mọi thứ](http://creatzynotes.blogspot.com/2020/11/ba-sinh-moi-thu-moi-thu-sinh-ba.html)”, but then “vacantism” was chosen when editing this document of Trinion.

				- “Trinion” = “Tri-” + “union” is the union of the three components. This puts more emphasis on _the unity of the three_, compared to other triads like the ((66b1cfa4-e22c-4424-bf19-a6ce4649da77)). This meaning is very much similar to [the “Holy Trinity”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity) in theism, where “Trinity” may be considered as “Tri-” + “unity”.
				- In the course of finding a term not to be confused with the “Holy Trinity”, the “Triad” or simply the “Three” have been considered. But then the term “Trinion” was coined to reflect the harmony of both [the Differentiation](((1a22a090-6786-4114-8aad-35b122783bff))) and [the Unification](((c96a6d20-a0f6-48bd-9d70-9bc00b6b3c69))) as the dynamic of [the Existence](((66f3d644-782c-4f33-bd5c-db6e0a2d447a))) which is not only a “[pre-existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-existence)”.

			  collapsed:: true
				- “Postulates” and “axioms” are both basic assumptions of a theory and are used as the foundation and starting points to build that theory upon. However, while “axioms” are statements taken to be self-evident, accepted to be “true obviously” without question nor controversy, as reflected in the adjective “axiomatic” and in axiomatic systems of mathematics, “postulates” are statements derived from our real-world experiences, like the five postulates of Euclid (in contrast with Euclid's five axioms), and like the principles of physics.
				- In particular, the three postulates of Unïnfo here are statements derived from the author's experience.
				- Hence, these postulates are not meant to be the “ultimate truth”, and the correspondent components are not meant to be the most fundamental [categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Categories) like in dualistic and plurualistic ontologies. These postulates are just proposed here to be the theory's starting points, which are open and will be revised again and again throughout the theory.

			  collapsed:: true
				- Respectively corresponding with the three components Circle, Arrow and Equal, the three intrinsic properties _static_, _dynamic_ and _balance_ are so intrinsic that none of them can stand alone.
				- Here we use the adjective “intrinsic” to emphasize the other underlying properties of a component over the apparent property of that component, e.g. the “Intrinsic Static” and the “Intrinsic Dynamic” versus the apparent “Balance” of the Equal.
				- Historically, while the West (Europe) has a long tradition of philosophy based on the Static, i.e. “existence” via “form”, “category”, “essence”, “element”, the East (from Islamic world, India, to China) has a long tradition of philosophy based on the Dynamic, e.g. “anicca” (अनिच्च, en. “impermanence”), “saṅkhāra” (सङ्खार, en. “formation”), “xíng” (行, en. “phase of transformation”), “yi” (易, en. “change”).
					- About the Balance, both the West and the East had focused on the moral balance, e.g. the inscription “Nothing in excess” in the temple of Apollo at Delphi, the “middle way” in Buddhism, the “Doctrine of the Mean” (中庸, Zhōngyōng) in Confucianism. Then in modern science, the role of Balance has been shown to be universal via equations.

					- From some messy content, the first insight of form apears when that content closes into a ((66ab675b-2778-4f51-80ad-20a8f6988691)) which is the conceived form, and this event is called ((670de10a-74a7-49e7-856f-b77b50f8e3c6)). That closed loop receives more content from its source (mother) and organizes its content into a ((66ab6f84-88ba-4660-b4b7-f6dcbdd58a4f)) circle which is the crystal form ready to be separated from its source. This process of crystallization is called ((66faa5f9-0b7a-49ca-a5f5-62eeba03ab2b)), and the separation from its source is the birth of the ((670de601-3ca8-4489-8b75-75ca0d9a74bc)).
					- After birth, the form learns and adapts to the environment by ((670e1e36-8929-4a91-8f29-95775c21988e))ing its crystal structure, i.e. pruning its structure of complete graph, and by [loading more contents](((670dee3b-4d37-4852-993c-bdb9cdd2c3bc))) from the outside onto its crystal form. Throughout its lifetime, the crystal form deforms more and more in interaction with other forms. This deformation is the deviatation from the roundness, the imbalance that makes its ((66c8772a-9b29-45b0-b169-2fa847333e02)) to rebalance by restoring force that pulls it back to the original roundness.
					- A multi-layered crystal form can bear distortion to the extent that an outer layer of ((670d0160-ee4c-4b5f-b95f-80b0c2f3825f)) is broken (sick). The inner layers will try to heal the the broken layer by closing it. Each healing crystallizes some content deeper into the core of the this crystal form as well as its components (gene). When the innermost layer is broken, the crystal form is dead, and its contents (components, children) are released to the world.
					- A death of a crystal form does end the form of the composite but does not end the forms of its components nor its children. The released components with their own crystal forms will continue to participate in the formation of new composites in the process of rebirth.
					- The crystal form of a composite is thus a ((667d16f8-206e-4a85-80f3-24c2aa1bf4ad)) to carry components of other kinds, to help them transform and crystallize content. It's also a producer to produce children of its own kind.

This new instance is combined to the source of the signal to develop the ((66ea8e12-7c30-449b-9139-bfd8d82394d7)), similar to the "object construction" in OOP. Each cycle of this process is call an ((66ea4597-f085-4f38-95f7-91bf5cd61b1c)). Each object on the screen is usually composed of several instances of several ((66ea8df3-d2f3-4856-b24a-5095dd285f9b))s. Only some special objects like the self body, the named objects, have a single corresponding past cone as its id knowledge. The instantiation is related to the "participation" in Plato's [Theory of Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms).

				- [!] My expression of "arrogance"
				  collapsed:: true
					- Even i've never thought that i'm better/higher than anyone else, my expression does show some trace of arrogance which has been fed back by my (close) friends. Is shows something is hidden deep inside my unconsciousness. Here i list some causes that i can reflect on this problem.
					- 1st, the **illusion of** ((66537674-6cf9-4459-8bea-7c1858c694a3))
					  id:: 669a58b9-422a-40d9-adcf-b2aade86c170
					  The (holistic) view from above shows me the way and makes me feel that "i've known the way already, it's just a piece of cake" and forget that it's just a "map" and the actual walking the way is much much harder with much more efforts.
						- I've called it by many names: the karma of theorist (theorist karma), the sickness of talent (talent sickness).
						- My karma of theorist also corrodes others' trust on me.
						  id:: 668f4faf-db30-497a-a271-b2bbf5264413
						- My karma of theorist is deep.... [inside my trousers 😄](https://www.facebook.com/lexuandinhct/posts/pfbid02kppLiTrw7mWPdp3V8bVLq6MvQDb3FNBaseh1znLspueCQrcC1esTKbsT4PCB8663l)
						  collapsed:: true
							- ![KarmaOfTheorist.jpg](../assets/Will/KarmaOfTheorist.jpg)
						- This illusion contributes greatly to ((669a58b9-1a52-4ad7-932a-9e45ecb9960e)).
					- 2nd, the **implosive attitude** of my inner self toward external forms as if i'm fighting for the abolition of these forms ("đả phá"). Even though i consider "all views are equal"... they are just "equal in theory" while in practice i have a hidden tendency to consider my "inner view through content" superior to the "external view through form" of others.
				- [!] The clash between internal work and external work
				  id:: 6677b986-ada2-4c73-8a11-980cdf9cb6d4
				  collapsed:: true
					- As i dive deep inside, it's hard to surface up to do external works, hence many delays in (official) works.
						- I'm hooked to the deep works in front of my eyes. This hook is the tool that helps me to concentrate and avoid distraction from surrounding environment.

						  :END:
							- Without distraction, it's easier for me to stay in the free & mindful state. But in the free state, it's also difficult for me to interact with external tools like note taking, speaking, writing, forming formula, etc.
							- This hook can be replaced with the [ujjayi breath](((66952126-bf33-40e1-a208-369df7aa9488))). Using the internal tool (breath) gives me more control than the external tool (external sink).
					- [!] When i interrupt the internal work, my self is fragmented, heavy, lack motivation to do anything.

							- The inertia/momentum of the internal work is too large to be changed (in direction) ⇒ delusion.
							- That large momentum + the need to change = overwhelmed, heavy resistance ⇒ aversion.
							- When such large momentum is forced to stop, leaving the void inside, the self is hungry ⇒ greed.
						- Solution: [Refine](((67b541d0-f477-4c3a-b444-fb522c3fdc4f))) the self obop to a small circle.
							- Magnitude of the form is small ⇒ high curvature, easy to change direction
							- Small self leaves room in the bodymind for external requirements ⇒ keep from aversion
							- Other different directions can be seen ⇒ clear & wise, not ignorant
							- The small self is never empty ⇒ no greed
							- To take action, the small self must combine with peripheral circles in the bodymind to drive them.
								- These peripheral circles are automatic motors working in the trained programs (karmas).
						- The total amount of contents in the bodymind is still sufficient thanks to temporary connection with peripheral circles in the form of pairs of opposites.
							- The opposites [keep the bodymind fully occupied](((6784f2aa-357a-44ed-a8c6-5ed1b9c78b04))) to get rid of the hunger, the greed, the wanting.
							- The opposites keep the dynamic center close to the static center ⇒ the sight line is level and points at [the horizon](((67445223-9459-4aa9-b102-70c63943577b))).
							- When needed to change direction, some peripheral circles must be released to return to the static center (neutral mode, [point mort](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/point_mort)) before engaging in any other direction.
						- [Reset](((67445065-15b2-475e-a704-78f140d487af)))tability: Peripheral circles must be trained to be released easily.

							- Other suggested techniques:
								- **Anchoring**: Touching a reminder object, like a [mala lace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japamala), hearing a sound, like a bell ring, or praying a mantra can help us to focus on the object and release other stuffs.
								- **Visualization**: Recalling the calm and focus of the meditative state that we're used to can help us release other stuffs.
							- Based on the experience & belief that _nothing is completely lost_, we can release them.

							- This [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) is just a kind of distortion in perspective view (projective/inversive geometry): 1/∞ = 0.
							  collapsed:: true
								- Our view is always distorted so that the far end always look shorter. So, when the goal is clearly visible to us, we can't help seeing the distance to it is short even if it's at infinity, just like the Moon looks very close to us at the horizon like "just some arms away".
							- The opposite of near-miss effect is the goal-fog effect where we lose motivation to reach a very near goal due to the obscurity of that goal.
							- It stems from ((669a58b9-422a-40d9-adcf-b2aade86c170))

								- *The target is the __hidden boss__*, the inner ((667c015e-6223-4f8a-ae84-a93a49f4ff94)) wall, the underlying driving force. My boss is the [holistic core](((681b24ad-2ec8-4e9f-bef6-eb77b09b5c9c))).

									- When a boss is brought out to the light, in front of everyone, to be examined like any one else, it loses its (absolute) privilege, and its influence is restored to the right place with the right amount. Its influence is still high thanks to its central position, but no more privilege, and the “boss” is now simply an individual equal to all other individuals in right.
									- It's different from shunting, suppressing the boss to eliminate its influence via rebellion, which is usually the counter effect of the long time overpowering by the boss.
							- The basic illustion is that “when the circle is completed, it ends, finishes, no more worry”, while actually it's just _the **beginning** of a new circle_, either at the same level or at “higher” level.
							- While the true ending, the true finish is the death, either bodily or mentally, we always try to reach the end of some “hard work” wishing to have an easier living, either on Earth or on Heaven, or at Nibbana (Nirvana). That's the basic illusion of both life & death.
								- The urge to finish is a manifestation of _the urge to die_ in the guise of life, either as an orgasm or an explosion.
									- While Freud described [death drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_drive) (Thanatos) as the opposite of sex drive (Eros), i see they are just two faces of the same coin with the same nature.
								- Due to the guise of life, we fall into the contradiction of continuously reaching (small) deaths in the hope of avoiding (big) death.
								- Accepting death is no problem to me and i've spent my whole life to explore various types of death.

										- Let's go, don't get too engrossed in this place.
										- But haven’t we already reached our destination?! After all the time, effort, sweat, and even blood we've spent to get here, shouldn’t we enjoy the fruits of our labor instead of moving on, master?!
										- I've allowed you to enjoy it for a whole week. If you think it's not enough, you can stay and enjoy it. I'll go alone.
										- It's not about enjoyment. I followed you to reach liberation, not to seek pleasure. If I wanted to enjoy myself, I would have stayed in the city with all its pleasures instead of tiring myself out climbing the mountain with you.
										- If you still want liberation, follow me.
										- But why do we need to move on when we've reached the destination of liberation?
										- This is not the destination.
										- Clearly, back in the city, when I asked, “Where do we go to find freedom?” you pointed to this mountain.
										- At that time, the city’s buildings blocked the view, so I had to point to a tall mountain for you to see. But I meant that “the destination lies at the horizon.”
										- So we can never reach the destination 😮‍💨?!
										- We can.
										- Have you reached the destination, master?
										- I have.
										- You're lying! Back in the city, I never saw the horizon, so you could fool me. But now, after months of travel, I've seen for myself: The horizon is endless. The more we walk towards it, the further it moves away, so we can never truly touch it.
										- I didn't deceive you. I only spoke in a way you could see and understand. Before, I didn’t say “the destination is the horizon” because you hadn't yet seen and understood what the horizon is. Today, I'm not deceiving you, either. I only speak according to what you now see. Now, look straight ahead; do you see the horizon?
										- I see the horizon as a straight line in front of me, but it’s just an illusion; there’s no actual line!
										- I only asked if you see it or not!
										- Yes, I see it.
										- Now, look behind; do you see the horizon?
										- Yes, I do.
										- Look to both the left and right; do you see the horizon?
										- Enough! On this mountaintop 🗻, wherever I look, I see the horizon. Don’t ask such redundant questions!!!
										- If you've seen it, let's go!
										- Why move on if we'll never reach it?!!!
										- I've reached it, that's why I'm leading you. If you don't want to go, you can stay here.
										- Wait, master, you can't leave! You owe me an explanation of how you can reach that endless horizon!
										- I've reached it by bringing the horizon right beneath my feet.
										- 😮 How is that possible...
										- I told you before that you wouldn't understand! It's only because you pushed me that I had to say it.

											- Ta đã cho con hưởng thụ cả tuần qua rồi đó thôi, nếu con thấy chưa đủ thì cứ ở lại hưởng thụ đi, thầy đi một mình.

											- Ta không lừa con, ta chỉ nói theo những gì con có thể thấy và hiểu được. Ngày trước ta không nói “đích là chân trời” vì lúc đó con chưa thấy và hiểu rõ chân trời là gì. Hôm nay ta cũng không lừa con, ta chỉ nói theo những gì con đang thấy mà thôi. Này, nhìn thẳng về trước, con có thấy chân trời không?
											- Con thấy chân trời như một đường thẳng trước mặt, nhưng đó chỉ là ảo giác, thực ra không có đường đó!
											- Ta chỉ hỏi có thấy hay không?!
											- Dạ có thấy.
											- Giờ quay về phía sau, con có thấy chân trời không?

											- Thấy rồi thì đi thôi!
											- Đi chẳng bao giờ tới thì đi làm gì cơ chứ?!!!
											- Ta đã tới rồi nên mới dẫn con đi. Con không muốn đi thì cứ ở lại đây.
											- Khoan, thầy không được đi! Thầy còn nợ con lời giải thích làm sao thầy có thể tới được cái chân trời vô tận đó!
											- Ta tới được bằng cách kéo chân trời về ngay dưới chân ta.

									- While the Self is mostly hidden (until full realization), the God-image is usually visible through symbols and figures. And the ego usually takes the visible God-image to be the image of the hidden Self, which may be wrong, prone to idealization and fixation.

								- William Shatner, after his 2021 spaceflight, described [“profound grief” alongside awe](https://thebonesspeak.com/the-overview-effect/), mourning Earth’s vulnerability amid environmental degradation.
									- [William Shatner experienced profound grief in space.](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/23/1130482740/william-shatner-jeff-bezos-space-travel-overview-effect)
									  > I wept for the Earth because I realized it's dying.
									- [William Shatner: My Trip to Space Filled Me With ‘Overwhelming Sadness’](https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/william-shatner-space-boldly-go-excerpt-1235395113/)
									  > It was among the strongest feelings of **grief** I have ever encountered. The contrast between the vicious coldness of space and the warm nurturing of Earth below filled me with **overwhelming sadness**. Every day, we are confronted with the knowledge of further destruction of Earth at our hands: the extinction of animal species, of flora and fauna . . . things that took five billion years to evolve, and suddenly we will never see them again because of the interference of mankind. It filled me with **dread**. My trip to space was supposed to be a celebration; instead, it felt like a **funeral**.
								- Seeing Earth as a “tiny, fragile ball” or even a [pale blue dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot) can diminish personal concerns but also make individuals *feel __disconnected__ from everyday life*. Upon returning to Earth, the astronauts may struggle to reconcile their cosmic perspective, e.g. seeing borders as artificial, with mundane realities or societal divisions, e.g. borders, politics. This can lead to **frustration** or a sense of powerlessness on Earth, as shown by Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell's [“drag a politician to space”](https://osl8.life/blog/understanding-the-overview-effect/).
									- Edgar Mitchell:
									  > You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense **dissatisfaction** with the state of the world, and a **compulsion** to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, ‘Look at that, you son of a bitch.’
								- Early X-15 pilots, as well as 90% of pilots so far, reported a [“break-off phenomenon”](https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/1957-clark.pdf), a negative experience of profound **isolation and sadness** when viewing Earth from high altitudes.

										- Frank White (author of “The Overview Effect” book (1987))
										  > Many of the great wisdom traditions of the Earth have pointed to what we're calling the "Overview Effect". That is to say they have realized this unity, this oneness, of all lives on Earth, and of consciousness and awareness.
										- David Loy (philosopher)
										  > Within the Western tradition, I think it's quite new, and quite shocking, because there's been much more of a sense of separation. But if you look at other non-Western cultures, especially in Asia, the emphasis on those has always been on the realization that the self and the world are not separate from each other, that they're really interconnected: that the individual self and the species as a whole is a manifestation of the large whole.
										- Frank White
										  > As you go into your mind in a contemplative way, the sense of the living reality of the planet becomes obvious, you become more in tune with the natural world. This is very akin to the direct perception that the astronauts have, so it's no wonder that many people have likened the Overview Effect to a spiritual or meditative experience, although it's not exactly that. It's a cognitive shift, that very often can produce a kind of meditative experience.

					- Or we must prune "unnecessary" links.
			- It runs somehow slower and heavier than ((66535660-643e-471a-a332-8f2306c5494f)).

				- **Hard-link** does keep index, but are [broken by git](((666ba5a7-598a-4b66-86bd-b1622a28ada6)))! This is the [better-than-nothing solution](((66978876-9378-4059-8783-868d041e8e2e))) now.

			  collapsed:: true
				- [discussed on Loseq Community](https://discuss.logseq.com/t/breadcrumb-navigation-bar-should-contain-the-target-item/27511)
			- [!] When a ((66610c13-5045-42a8-948f-6426d698fd2c)) is referenced in another block, that enclosing block has a different block id which can be...
			  id:: 66680966-5c6a-4c14-82b5-bc1c3f65c525
			  collapsed:: true
				- ((66680966-5c6a-4c14-82b5-bc1c3f65c525)) referenced in yet another block.
				- But if the intermediate block does not have extra words, i.e. only the original block id, like this:
					- ((66610c13-5045-42a8-948f-6426d698fd2c))
					  id:: 66680ac9-70a7-4648-acda-4caa887bd447
					- Then the next level of ref, like this ((66680ac9-70a7-4648-acda-4caa887bd447)), cannot stop at the intermediate block, but jump directly to the original block.
					  id:: 66680ada-076d-47c8-b827-91fae9c3d4a2
					- However the preview does show the both intermediate block and original block (overlaying): just hover this ((66680ac9-70a7-4648-acda-4caa887bd447)), don't click!
					- => Better behavior: Preview shows non-overlaying blocks and ask for level of links to jump when clicking the link.

											- Ref: [Regular expression to match balanced parentheses](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35271017/789095)
									- [Idealy](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#link-best-practices), link text should not contain brackets, and parentheses in link target should be esceped: `(` = `%28`, `)` = `%29`
										- E.g. This links to [{wiki} Parenthesis_(rhetoric)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenthesis_%28rhetoric%29)
										- Because any unmatched bracket/parenthesis will break the link sysntax with broken text displayed.
