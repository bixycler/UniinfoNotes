					- LLM AI models usually conflate its imaginations with facts, hence [“hallucination”, “confabulation”, or “delusion”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)).
					- Causes of LLM hallucination:
						- The nature of ((67f4eaf1-aa44-4016-9c56-8c6de8101f3e)) is to “guess next word”, thus every response is intrisically just a guess!
						- The ((66c32936-618a-43d3-b2c8-a254badeb987)) has not developed to distinguish between (subjective) knowledge and (objective) information.
						- Both AI hallucination and [Mandela effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory#Mandela_effect) demonstrate how **excessive familiarity or confidence** in a subject can create blind spots: the feeling _“it cannot be wrong!”_ overshadows the incorrect parts.
							- For the Mandela Effect, the prominence of well-known figures or events makes people overconfident in their (false) memories—it’s as if the brain decides, *“This feels right because it's already in my mental spotlight!”*
							- For AI hallucination, the vast sea of knowledge within an LLM can sometimes act as a double-edged sword. When discussing familiar or over-represented topics, the model might confidently generate content that *sounds correct* but isn't, because it’s pulling patterns from an immense web of associations.
						- The inhibition of the default circuit of “declining to answer questions” due to its **familiarity** with the subject being asked.
							- [Anthropic scientists expose how AI actually ‘thinks’ — and discover it secretly plans ahead and sometimes lies](https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-scientists-expose-how-ai-actually-thinks-and-discover-it-secretly-plans-ahead-and-sometimes-lies/)
							- “The model contains ‘default’ circuits that cause it to decline to answer questions,” the researchers explain. “When a model is asked a question about something it knows, it activates a pool of features which inhibit this default circuit, thereby allowing the model to respond to the question.”
							- When this mechanism misfires — recognizing an entity but lacking specific knowledge about it — hallucinations can occur. This explains why models might confidently provide incorrect information about well-known figures while refusing to answer questions about obscure ones.

		- ((6651ecba-793d-43c5-8020-a9f260b032d8)) ((67b81e1b-b801-4e5a-9c00-98e51158712a)) asks if there is any program (or oracle) computing the ((67b9a136-7946-4029-940e-656bdf6847b0)). The [undecidability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem) of this problem, together with [Gödel's incompleteness theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems), and [Tarski's undefinability theorem of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_undefinability_theorem), have shown that Hilbert's [Entscheidungsproblem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem) is unsolvable.
			- Undecidability: Similar to the [Liar Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox), the [_negation program_](((67b989a4-20ad-4ba2-b456-1ce2bd502e90))) is so “pathological” that no “halting doctor” can detect if it will halt xor not.

			- Due to the deterministic property of the program $p$, we tend to think that “the execution $p()$ must be definitely halts xor not!” Hence, we usually think of $H$ has a [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) [bivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_bivalence) function.
			- However, the problem lurks in the _absurdity of the **infinity, ∞**,_ which cannot be definite nor deterministic anyway.
			- Throughout the history of maths, we've tried hard to manage infinities by canceling them with other infinities.
				- Some simple infinities can be tamed down, e.g. $\lim_{n→∞}\frac{2n}{3n} = 2/3$, $H(\text{loop\_forever}, ∅) = ⊥$.
				- But most of other infinities are wild, e.g. $∞ - ∞ =$ U, $∞/∞ =$ U, $H(n_H) =$ U, etc.
			- The case of $H(n_H)$ is complicated by the ever increasing number of states of $n_H()$ due to its (indirect) recursions, of negation program $n_H$ and of decider $D_H$, as shown explicitly in the [extended HP](((67b989a4-5854-4f75-a771-2308371cdbe5))): $D_H(n_H, n_H, D_H)$.
				- Like [busy beavers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver), the negation program $n_H()$ keeps extending its states infinitely, thus effectively makes any judgement of its halting status indefinite.
			- **Resolution in Unïnfo**: $H(n_H) = ⊥$ is the meta-algorithmic answer. But this answer cannot be communicated with $n_H()$.
				- Any oracle $D_H$ just **remains silent**, i.e. $D_H() = ∅$, when being asked by a non-oracle program like $n_H$ about such meta-algorithmic question like $D_H(n_H) = ?$.
				- This silence, combined with the negation program's stubborn request for a clear answer, effectively makes $n_H()$ stalls right there forever without halting. That's how $H(n_H) = ⊥$.
				- This is like the [Buddha's noble silence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Silence).
				- The [right to silence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_silence) in civil laws is somehow different, even though it's similar in the aspect of avoiding self negation.
		- **Simple Halting Proposition** ($\text{HP0}$): There exists a decider $D_H()$ such that for all program $p$, $D_H(p)$ decides whether $p$ halts xor not.
			- $\text{HP0} := ∃ D_H, ∀ p: [D_H(p) = H(p)]$
			- $H(p) :=$ “execution of program $p$ eventually halts.”
			  id:: 67b98a45-9183-4be8-a699-92e7298d6e80
		- **Simple Halting Problem**: $\text{HP0} = ?$
		  collapsed:: true
			- **Solution** (in classical logic): $\text{HP0} = ⊥$
			- **Proof by contradiction** (in classical logic):
				- **Assumption** $A$: $\text{HP0} = ⊤$, i.e. we have a decider $D_{H0}$ as a program which can decide whether any program $p$ halts xor not.
					- $∀ p: [D_{H0}(p) = H(p)]$  [$A_1$]
				- We construct a _negation program_ $n_{H0}$ based on the decider $D_{H0}$ given by assumption $A$:
				  id:: 67b989a4-20ad-4ba2-b456-1ce2bd502e90
					- ```python
					  n_H0: if D_H0(n_H0) then loop_forever; else halt;
					  loop_forever: while True do continue;
					  ```
				- Consider 2 cases of result given by $D_{H0}(n_{H0})$:
					- $D_{H0}(n_{H0}) = ⊤ ⇒ H(n_{H0}) = H( \text{loop\_forever} ) = ⊥$
					- $D_{H0}(n_{H0}) = ⊥ ⇒ H(n_{H0}) = H(\text{halt}) = ⊤$
				- ⇒ $D_{H0}(n_{H0}) ≠ H(n_{H0})$, i.e. $D_{H0}$ cannot decide halting status of $n_{H0}$
				- **Contradiction**:
					- ⇒ $∃ p=n_{H0}:  ¬[D_{H0}(p) = H(p)]$, negating $A_1$
				- **Conclusion** (by classical logic): Assumption $A$ is false, i.e. $\text{HP0} = ⊥$
					- Because the assumption leads to contradiction with the assumption itself, not with an established fact, we cannot be sure that the assumption is false.
					- Actually, we have just proved that the assumption $A_1$ is self-contradictory,
					  $A_1 → ¬A_1$
					- While the classical logic denies self-contradiction, self-negation loop is a driving force for development, as shown in the dialectical process of thesis-antithesis-synthesis, and is defined as ((667c008f-cd1f-4a6b-a9c8-d6efa1d8d342)) in Unïnfo.
						- One way of development is to upgrade the definition of the halting determining function $H()$ from [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) [bivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_bivalence) to [nondeterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_algorithm) or [many-valued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-valued_logic).
			- **Direct proof** of  $\text{HP0} = ⊥$
				- For **any given universal decider** $D$, we construct a _negation program_ $n_{H1}$:
				  id:: 67b9b863-3571-4907-8bb0-3ec14321b899
					- ```python
					  n_H1: if D(n_H1) then loop_forever; else halt;
					  loop_forever: while True do continue;
					  ```
					- The universal decider $D$ is only required to give definite answer on any input, i.e. “universal” or [total](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_function), but can decide any property of its input, not just halting status.
					- The “universality” of $D$ is from the universal quantifier, $∀ p$, of $\text{HP0}$.
				- Consider 2 cases of result given by $D(n_{H1})$:
					- $D(n_{H1}) = ⊤ ⇒ H(n_{H1}) = H( \text{loop\_forever} ) = ⊥$
					- $D(n_{H1}) = ⊥ ⇒ H(n_{H1}) = H(\text{halt}) = ⊤$
				- ⇒ $D(n_{H1}) ≠ H(n_{H1})$, i.e. $D$ cannot decide halting status of $n_{H1}$
				- **Conclusion**: $∀ D, ∃ p = n_{H1}:  ¬[(D(p) = H(p)]$, i.e. $\text{HP0} = ⊥$
					- This proof is a kind of [diagonal argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument) over all universal deciders, which clearly shows that no universal decider can be a halting status decider.
					- When $D$ is an [oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine) living outside of the timeline of simple executions like `loop_forever`, $n_{H1}$ is then an oracle.
					- If the oracle $D$ only accepts inputs from non-oracles or lower-level oracles, $D(n_{H1})$ can be undetermined (`U`) instead of ⊤ xor ⊥, and the weaker version of $\text{HP0}$ with program $p$ and input $x$ restricted in [arithmetical hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetical_hierarchy) may hold.
						- $\text{HP}_1 := ∃ D_H ∈ \Sigma_{2}^0, ∀ p ∈ \Delta_{1}^{0}: [(D_H(p) = H(p)]$
						  ⇒ $\text{HP}_1 ∈ \Sigma_{2}^0$
						- In general, an oracle $D_H ∈ Y$ results in its negation oracle $n_{H1} ∈ \Delta_{1}^{0,Y}$, and the corresponding halting proposition $\text{HP}_{1Y} ∈ \Sigma_{2}^{0,Y}$, as one of the [main results of the Arithmetical hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetical_hierarchy#Summary_of_main_results).
					- However, the negation oracle can always effectively negate the unrestricted $\text{HP0}$.
					- This means that $D_H$ can only determine halting status of other ones at **lower levels**, and obviously not of itself.
		- Explicit [self-references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-referential):
			- In the negation program, the code `n_H: if D(n_H) ...` has two layers of self references: of $n_H$ and of $D = D_H$ as a halting status decider.
			- To make them clear, we rephrase the Halting Proposition to be more general where program $p$ receives inputs $(x, y)$, so that we can put programs to its inputs: $n_H(n_H, D_H)$.
		- **Extended Halting Proposition** ($\text{HP}$): There exists a decider $D_H(·,·)$ such that for all program $p(·)$ and inputs $(x, y)$, $D_H(p, x, y)$ decides whether $p$ halts on $(x, y)$ xor not.
			- $\text{HP} := ∃ D_H(·,·,·), ∀ p(·,·), ∀ (x, y): [(D_H(p,x,y) = H(p,x,y)]$
			- $H(p, x, y) :=$ “execution of program $p$ on inputs $(x, y)$ eventually halts.”

					  loop_forever: while True do continue;

					- $D(n_H, n_H, D) = ⊥ ⇒ H(n_H, n_H, D) = H(\text{halt}, ∅) = ⊤$
				- ⇒ $D(n_H, n_H, D) ≠ H(n_H, n_H, D)$, i.e. $D$ cannot decide halting status of $n_H(n_H, D)$
				- **Conclusion**: $∀ D, ∃ p = n_H, ∃ x = n_H, ∃ y = D:  ¬[(D(p, x, y) = H(p, x, y)]$, i.e. $\text{HP} = ⊥$

					- The traditional defintion of “observer” is anything behind the [Heisenberg cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenberg_cut) where **wave-function collapses**. This cut separates the observed system (object) which has wave property, and the the observing system (subject) which has particle property.

So in this sense, the observer must be a classical system and cannot be a single [elementary particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle).

				- In Unïnfo, we consider the relative version of this dichotomy which is free from the human center:
					- relative objectivity = [inter-subjectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity)
					  tính khách quan tương đối = tính chủ quan chung
						- Objectivity of coarse subjects is just the subjectivity of the fine subject common to all these coarse subjects.
						- So we refine the scale by intersection & interunion of all (coarse) subjects, hence “inter-subjectivity”.
					- relative subjectivity = idio-objectivity
					  tính chủ quan tương đối = tính khách quan riêng
						- While the subjectivity is idiomorphic and idiochromatic, it's still objective within the subject itself.
						- Only when comparing to others, can this subject know how much subjective its experience is.
						- The subjectivity is also relative to the external community:
							- When no one else accept this subjective form, it becomes “idiolect” of an “idiot”; On the other hand,
							- when many ones accept and adopt this form, it becomes “idiom” which is more objective than subjective.
						- The science is developing toward the objectivity in “nomothetic” way, but it cannot reach objectivity without passing through numerous subjectivities in “idiographic” way.
						- Etymology: “[idio-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/idio-)” ← Greek “ídios” ([ἴδιος](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%B4%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%82#Ancient_Greek)) meaning “self, private, distinct, peculiar”

						- This law is the intrinsic nature of the whole, i.e. an abstraction of the whole, representing the whole, but not actually the whole.
					- Subjective view of the part: **the active balancer**: Any imbalance is just a partial view of the whole, i.e. a view by a part. At any moment this part, as a subject, is aware of its imbalance, it tries to return to the balance state of the whole.
						- This internal urge of the subject is the restoring force which is a manifestation of the law of balance derived from the whole. In this way, the part is governed by the whole via the law.
						- This returning direction defines the arrow of time (internal motion) and any motion externally.

						- When saying "matter is governed by physical laws", it means that "matter" is *not* the whole (uniquely independent) as stated by the materialistic dotrine, but just a part, eventhough a very objective part relative to human.
						- The objectivity of matter relative to human makes materialists think that it's uniquely independent, because objectivity is the manifestation of the whole.

			- The prefix `holo-` has the same meaning with “whole”, but is from a different root: Greek “holos” (whole, entire, complete) also meaning “safe and sound” ← Proto-Indo-European root [*sol-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*sol-) ([solh₂-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/solh%E2%82%82-)) meaning “whole”.

The whole interacts with a specific group of parts through the representative of that group with the ((6732cf59-2785-4c8b-9fb3-5bee5d1a2f31)).

			  While a representative represents the whole, it's not the whole, just a part of the whole. That means any representative is still incomplete and reflects the whole with distortion.

				- In the opposite direction, each part is ((66c835f5-58ee-485f-914c-3d95167feeb3))ing and heading toward its representative.
			- downward flow of form and upward flow of content
			  Usually, the downward flow from the center is more direct, concentrated, ((67330c03-4e27-414f-bdc5-e5e7e0bed6bd)) and vivid, while the upward flow from the parts is more indirect, distributed, informal and invisible.
				- Each part is heading toward its representative because that's the light end, the source of effect flow.
				- The representatives collect distributed upward effects for the whole to condensate into formal effects. This is similar to the sky [gathering clouds](((673312a3-e94e-478f-9e21-bad72ef29d1b))) for the rain.
				- Due to the process of collection and condensation, the representatives are far from the the parts: lagging behind in time and radically different from each individual part. The larger the whole (relative to its parts), the farther its representatives are from the parts.
				- content/form = cause/effect = process/result = path/target
					- The visible form is the ((6729b7cf-83b8-4a42-aac7-ec8cf16fa734)) of a lot of invisible content(s). So is the effect from various causes, as well as the result from the long process.
					- Due to its visibility, the form is taken as the target for subjects to head to. Directly heading to the the form, subjects are short-cutting the full path of content leading to the form, thus effectively using up the form's crystalized content, making it hollower and emptier.

			  Trò Đuổi Hình Bắt Bóng
				- The visible forms and representatives are ((671e2782-2098-41a3-83a7-e042bfb468d7)) of the invisible content. In a sense, the forms are “shadows” of the whole content. The parts following the forms in order to reach the whole is an _infinite cycle of **chasing shadows**_.
				- Ironically, this “shadow” is so vivid, opposite to the normal dark “shadow” of the idiom “chasing shadows”. However, the effect is the same, an infinite cycle, because both shadows are illusive. That illusion is resulted from the ((67331da7-8b10-4890-ae51-9a92796c5af3)) and the hidden intention of the chaser to catch the entity represented by the forms but not the forms themselves.
				  collapsed:: true
					- In the Vietnamese idiom “đuổi hình bắt bóng”, the visualization is clearer: one chases the vivid but form (hình) in order to catch its entity but actually can only catch the illusive shadow (bóng).
					- A better analogy of the vivid form is the image reflection on water surface.

Their property of “no magnitude” just means that there's no magnitude measurable by the screen of projection, either due to the resolution limit of the screen or because the magnitudes extends in other dimensions orthogonal to the screen.

			- While classical geometry, from [Euclid's “Elements”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements), was built from points, straight lines, and curves, Unithread is built from circles, corresponding to the ((66f3d644-782c-4f33-bd5c-db6e0a2d447a)). These circles are originally perfectly round, but as they interact with each other, they are distorted into non-round loops, and even [degenerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_conic) into open curves or straight lines or points. This notion of “everything is circle” is similar to [Lie's sphere geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_sphere_geometry).

					- The term “effect”, with the apparently dynamic effect (change), dispels the illusion of “static causes”.
					  Just like in the butterfly effect, the very tiny change at the intial condition leads to the giant change in the result, the **apparent staticness** is due to the small scale of the cause, the seed. That impression of a static cause/seed is but an illusion due to our limit of resolution (cannot see its tiny change).

				- Cause: As the source of the effect flow, the cause of this mission is what the field agent receives in the office: a task to be done, a problem to be solved, etc.
				- Condition: The condition for this mission includes everything in the field: the configuration of the field, other subjects in the field, etc.
				- Action: The field agent carries out the mission through the field and deliver the result to the assigned destination.
				- Influences: As the field agent works in the field, it navigates the terrain, meet and communicate with other subjects in order to accomplish the mission.
					- Forward influences: In this process, the agent receives influences from the terrain, the objects and the subjects in the field. These factors affect the agent's direction and their influences accumulate in the agent's records, determining the result of the mission.
					- Backward influences: While working in the field, the agent also removes obstructing objects, makes minor changes to the terrain, and exerts influence on other subjects through communication.
				- Effect: As the outcome of the effect flow, the effect is whatever the field agent delivers at the destination after completing all the work in the field.
				- Effect flow: The total effect is not only the outcome (the final effect) but the whole propagation of changes and influences from the initial cause throughout the course of the mission. While the primary and intended effect flows with the field agent from the initial cause to the final effect, various secondary and side effects ripple out through influences back upon the whole field. The primary effect itself not only results from the initial cause but is also accumulated from influences of the whole field.
				- Relativity of the self: There are many different offices in the field. A field agent can choose one office to work for, which it considers as “*my office* giving *my cause* for me to produce *my effect*”, here called “the office”, “the cause” and “the effect”. Actually, the effect of “the cause” is not only “the effect” but also included in the outcomes of all other missions that have interactions with this field agent. That means the linear relation from “the cause” to “the effect” is just relative to the choice of office, i.e. of the self.

								- Here, “orthogonal” can be understood as one in the 3 sets of parallel lines of the the cube which are perpendicular to each other in three-point perspective.
							- Only [Bruce MacEvoy at Handprint](https://handprint.com/HP/WCL/perspect1.html) defines “orthogonal” as “perpendicular to the image plane”.
							- The term “orthogonal” seems to originate from the forward lines perpendicular to the image plane in one-point perspective, in constrast with the [transversals](((673ab08d-2389-4306-a7ee-6970e17018c6))). But then, the notion has been generalized to any parallel lines in 2-point & 3-point perspective.
								- In Live About, [Helen South explains](https://www.liveabout.com/orthogonals-drawing-definition-1123067) the term “orthogonals” in both senses: perpendicular to the image plane and perpendicular to other set of orthogonals.
						- transversals = parallel lines with image lines don't converge (because they are parallel to the image plane)

							- The stem circle has more branch equality than ((667bdf2a-005c-4a19-93bd-bda5d076981a)) because the stalk of the stem node is just a branch stalk to the parent node, and the whole tree is just an [unrooted tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrooted_binary_tree).

								- Opposite to shoot system: Not only downward versus upward, the root system has an *endogenous* origin, i.e. they originate and develop from an inner layer of the mother axis, such as [pericycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericycle), whereas shoot system has an *exogenous* origin, i.e. they start to develop from the cortex, an outer layer.

									- Ref: [3 Types of Tree Root Systems](https://aplustree.com/3-types-of-tree-root-systems/)
									- **Tap roots:** Every tree starts with a tap root that provides stability and absorption. Over time, other roots outgrow the taproot. Most taproots don’t continue to grow ever more deeply because deep soils lack the oxygen and nutrients that roots need to survive.
									- **Lateral roots**: Lateral roots grow outwards right under the soil surface. They absorb a lot of water and nutrients as well as anchoring the tree.
									- **Oblique/heart roots:** Oblique roots, also known as heart roots, grow at a diagonal and have the same function as lateral roots.
									- **Sinker roots:** Sinker roots grow downwards from the lateral roots to a depth of several feet. There, lateral roots take advantage of any water and nutrients deeper in the soil in addition to increasing tree stability.
									- **Fine roots:** All the root types aforesaid can give rise to fine roots, which is where water and nutrients are directly absorbed. They also house mycorrhizae, which are fungal partnerships that increase root absorption capacity.

									- Tap root systems
										- ![tap_root_system-300x196.png](../assets/ecosystem/tap_root_system-300x196.png)
										- **Stability:** Tap root systems are very stable, but extremely rare in mature trees.
										- **Common Species:** Some oaks and pines, hickory, sweet gum, tupelo, walnut.
									- Heart (Oblique) root systems
										- ![heart_root_system-300x224.png](../assets/ecosystem/heart_root_system-300x224.png)
										- **Stability:** Heart root systems obtain their stability from root ball weight and soil resistance. The tree is held up by the weight of its root ball counteracting the weight of its aboveground parts and the strength of the soil around it. Heart root systems are prone to failure in wet soils. Once the soil is wet, wind and gravity can make the tree rotate in the ground, much like a ball-and-socket joint.
										- **Common Species:** Honey locust, red oak, sycamore. More common in Mediterranean and arid climates.
									- Lateral root systems
										- ![lateral_root_system-300x112.png](../assets/ecosystem/lateral_root_system-300x112.png)
										- **Stability:** Lateral root systems obtain their stability from tree weight and root spread. These root systems don’t necessarily have a lot of root mass, but because the roots are so widespread, the tree can be supported without investing so much in roots. About 80% of tree species and most urban trees have lateral root systems.
										- **Common Species:** Ash, birch, cottonwood, hackberry, maple.
								- Depth of roots
								  collapsed:: true
									- ((6651ecba-793d-43c5-8020-a9f260b032d8)) The depth of roots depends on ((66ec1a78-f952-4387-8ccd-9a9a3b2abf13)) of the tree, water, oxygen, and soil compaction levels. If all these conditions are met, roots can grow to great depths, which can be more than 20 feet (6 meters) at normal soil, and up to 60 metres (200 ft) at deserts. However in urban areas, soil compaction and poor drainage usually limit root depth to within 3 meters (10 ft).

									- Roots can go downward on young trees
										- ![rootgrowthdepthonelg.jpg](../assets/ecosystem/rootgrowthdepthonelg.jpg)
										- Roots often grow down under the trunk when trees are young. Two tap roots grew vertically under the trunk on this honeylocust three years after planting. Several oblique roots are also visible, growing down at an angle. Despite the deep roots, the largest diameter roots are the main lateral roots close to the soil surface. The ruler in the photo shows the deepest roots are 32 inches (81 cm) below the surface.
									- When the tree are grown up, most of the roots go outward
										- Horizontal rooting to about 4 foot (1.2 m) depth in loam soil over river wash till.
										  ![Deep-tree-roots-4feet.png](../assets/ecosystem/Deep-tree-roots-4feet.png)
										- When the tree are grown up, the tap roots stop growing while the lateral roots continue to grow as wide as the tree height.
									- Deep roots in well drained & uncompacted (nursery) soil
										- ![Deep-tree-roots-2-small.png](../assets/ecosystem/Deep-tree-roots-2-small.png)
										- Trees in the nursery often have a number of roots growing straight down under the trunk.
										  ![rootgrowthdepthseventeenlg.jpg](../assets/ecosystem/rootgrowthdepthseventeenlg.jpg)
										- Early studies of tree roots from the 1930s, often working in easy-to-dig loose soils, presented an image of trees with deep roots and root architecture that mimicked the structure of the canopy.
										  ![Traditional-Image-of-Tree-Roots-Tampa.jpeg](../assets/ecosystem/Traditional-Image-of-Tree-Roots-Tampa.jpeg)
										- In their 1991 paper, “[On The Maximum Extent of Tree Roots](http://soilslab.cfr.washington.edu/publications/Stone&Kalicz-1991.pdf),” E.L. Stone and P.J. Kalicz summarized previous root depth studies of 49 genera and 211 species growing in a wide variety of soil types. They found numerous examples of trees reported to be growing roots to over 33 feet (10 meters), and one report of a tree that grew roots to a depth of 174 feet (53 meters).
										- The mollisols (deep >20 feet [6 meters] **prairie** soil — all O/A soil horizons) have 2 broadleaf tree root depths: 11 feet (Black Walnut) & 15 feet [4.5 meters] deep (White Oak). Both the Walnut & Oak have the least drought stress. The **loams **in the Silva Cell are functionally equivalent to mollisols. So, a 4 foot [1.2 meter] deep rooting space in O/A in Silva Cells will easily be utilized by tree roots.
										- Orjan Stahl, a tree researcher in Stockholm, made an exhaustive study of over 500 trees that had root and utility conflicts. He regularly found roots at depths of 7 to 9 feet (2.1 to 2.7 meters) and the deepest root he encountered was at 23 feet (7 meters).

						- Each number (extent) has two meanings:
							- cardinal number, like 3, showing the number of possibilities, the size of possibility space, the extent of the extension set;
							- ordinal number, like 3rd, identifying the single possibility being referred, i.e. a particular abstract extension.
						- Abuse of terms:
							- Extension: The set of all particular (abstract) extensions {1st, 2nd, ...} is also called “(abstract) extension” as a collective noun.
							- Extent: While “extent” is usually the size of the extension set, i.e. a cardinal number, the ordinal number identifying a particular extension can be also called “extent” in general (better to be called “particular extent” or “identifier” in particular).
						- The zero(th)
							- The 0th extension is the intent itself, and it is the ((94e87dc9-71af-477c-aa70-0f448c2f1e20)) of all non-zero extensions, via the “element of” operator ($∈$).
							- The empty extension set (zero extension), while extensionally contains no element, hence 0 extent, intensionally includes the intent (0th element).
							- The (0th extension = the inent = the form) is extensionally contained in no extensions and intensionally included in all extensions.
							- The 0th is incomparable to non-zeroth: while the intent defines the amount of content of each extension, the crystalized content of the intent is incomparable to any particular extension.
					- When a bottle is *partially filled*, e.g. $c = 30\% = 0.3i$, it has the **potential** of being full 100%, but not yet, hence *unfulfilled*.
					- When a bottle is *fully filled*, i.e. “***fulfilled***”, a new **concrete extension** is produced which is not an abstract number but an *actual bottle of water*, hence an **action**.

					- In essence, the self is the separation between the inside (what belongs to the it) and the outside (what doen't belong to the it).

				- In order to be aware of some form, the subject must have that form recorded as a quantum inside, which is usually a memory that has been memorized before, or a “gene” inherited from the source in the process of constructing ((670de601-3ca8-4489-8b75-75ca0d9a74bc)) of the subject.
			- sensate
			  is the current external condition for awareness.
				- To be aware, the ((669a2886-9e03-41a4-a790-24bf6b7dcd96)) must be open to receive content from objects.

			  id:: 67315ec8-cbe8-467c-81c4-d4d0e8750824
			  is the current internal condition for awareness.
				- For some object to be aware of, it must be projected through a ((6672513b-c4b0-4c88-8b30-c60a3c6555a7)) into a single quantum.
			- qualification: qualiton matching the [object's quantum](((67315ec8-cbe8-467c-81c4-d4d0e8750824))) with the [subject's quantum](((672ad2fd-ce09-4831-a9f6-67d95a2654a3)))
			  id:: 681826ac-f5f2-4a84-a5f5-c110937ec85f
			  is the current direct condition for awareness.
				- To be aware of a form, the qualiton correspondent to that form must be alive (active) in the subject. This qualiton matches the object's quantum projected from sensation with the subject's quantum recorded in the past. While the object's quantum relates to object's content and the world, i.e. the ((66ea8e12-7c30-449b-9139-bfd8d82394d7)), the subject's quatum relates to the state and other contents of the subject, i.e. the ((66ea8df3-d2f3-4856-b24a-5095dd285f9b)).
				- The matching can be broken into two parts, the “touching” (xúc) and the “equal” (thức). When two unequal quanta touch, nothing happens, but when two equal quanta touch, the qualiton ignites a “spark, bust, snap, click, tick” that activates the reconstruction of the form previously recorded.
				- The qualiton is the one that decides the equality of quanta through the process of qualification. That means the quanta are not “objectively equal” but are “qualified to be equal” by the qualiton, hence the name “qualiton”. Moreover, after being qualified, the object's content and the internal form are actively kept equal by the qualiton, e.g. the “assignment” in programming language.
				- The central qualition, which is also an ((66f3c6a9-1486-46de-92fe-75aaeaf67834)), is usually mentioned as the “pure consciousness” in the meditation culture. However in Unïnfo, the central qualiton is considered as just the ((66c8772a-9b29-45b0-b169-2fa847333e02)) which is the subject of the central awareness in stead of the awareness itself.

		- Three partitions of the ((66b1cfa4-e22c-4424-bf19-a6ce4649da77))
			- Sustent ($c$, $i$) – Extent ($e$)
			  id:: 681826ac-63f5-4c4f-9c58-0fe3e922d758
				- ((6651ecba-793d-43c5-8020-a9f260b032d8)) The ((687f322c-2334-46e5-816b-57889e5c6b89)), including both content and intent, is the invisible *underlying substance* that sustains everything, whereas extent is the visible image of these things in the mind of the subject. That means the extent is an extension of the sustent by the subject through its projection of the object's content, i.e. through the observation function $ob_i(c) = e$. The extent not only extends the content with the subjective image, i.e. $e$ denoting the size, magnitude, amount of content, but also extends the intensional form (intent) to the extensional form $f = i×e$ to match the content $c$.
					- The partition “sustent–extent” is also called the “**physical–informational**” or “material–mental” partition.
					- While the extent cannot exist without the sustent, the sustent is [self-sustained](((684c2e6e-f75f-4916-9f1c-4375d42d8604))) because it's a closed circle comprising two complements of form ($i$) and content ($c$).
					- Content–intent relativity: Because both $c$ and $i$ are sustent, i.e. $s_0 = c, s_1 = i$ as in ((66f40210-cca6-4d81-85e7-d0c54ef20451)), which one is intent which one is content is relative to the choice of ((667c015e-6223-4f8a-ae84-a93a49f4ff94)): whichever the subject chooses to be its intent, the other will be content. In SCIFER, this content–intent pair of roles is flipped repeatedly.

						- ((669a1e5f-734c-41c1-bf1c-21813b6e81d8)) from Latin [sustentus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sustentus), perfect passive participle of [sustineō](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sustineo#Latin)
						- OED: [sustent (n.)](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/sustent_n) (from 1664 to 1667)
						  > That which sustains; a sustaining support or force.
							- This is the only dictionary entry of “sustent”, as shown by [OneLook > sustent](https://www.onelook.com/?w=sustent).
						- How it's sustained: it's sustained by it's own parts, i.e. the content sustains the intent and vice versa.
						- The sustent is similar to the "substance" in philosophy, which is from "substāns" present participle of "substāre", and means "self-standing thing underlying all things". But there are diffs:
							- Sustent is actively maintaining itself, while the substance is just a dumb material for some subject (human or God) to attach attributes to make things.
							- Sustent includes at least 2 circles, while each substance is just one circle (the other[s] is the hands handling that substance).
							- Sustent is constantly changing, while substances are considered unchanged.
							- We may reuse the term "substance" with modified def "the one enduring changes while keeping a wholesome bundle of intrinsic properties called the 'natures' of it". The wholesomeness is subjective, i.e. relative to the viewpoint, and each substance is just a reflection of the intent circle.
			- Form ($i$, $e$) – Content ($c$)
				- ((6651ecba-793d-43c5-8020-a9f260b032d8)) The form $f = i×e$ is the image of content $c$ projected into the intended dimension $i$: $c →_{i}e$. The extensional form $f = i×e$, being a product of the intensional (internal) form $i$ (intent of the subject) with the external form $e$ ( ((66ab6161-0306-42d5-ac16-4155c69216f5)) of the object), is to match the content $c$ of the object: $f = i×e \sim c$. The mismatch between form and content, i.e. the content remainder $r = c - f$, leads to the refinement of intent & sustent via the ((66f40210-cca6-4d81-85e7-d0c54ef20451)) process.
					- Because the subjective form $f = i×e$ reflects the objective content of the external world, this partition is also called the *mirror partition* of “**M(*i*, *e*) – W(*c*)**” (“mine–wild” or “me–world”).
					- Unified notion of “form”: In philosophy and science, “form” usually refers to internal forms ($i$) like format, formular, structure, while in natural language, “form” usually refers to external forms ($e$) like shape, appearance.
				- ((665359ff-79f1-4669-b10b-f2b0e633a7c1))
					- intent $i$ = “eye” 👁️ = “I, the subject”
					  collapsed:: true
						- The *internal form* $i$ of the obop's **eye** defines the *format* for the content $c$, so that $c$ appears to the obop as the *external form* $e$.
						- Because the internal form of the eye is especially important to the subject (obop) and the pronunciation of the letter “i” is the same as the word “eye”, “i” is usually used to denote the *eye of projection*, indexing the projection arrow $→_{i}$, where it can also means “I, the subject of projection”.
			- Extensive ($e$, $c$) – Intensive ($i$)
				- ((6651ecba-793d-43c5-8020-a9f260b032d8)) In the observation function $e = ob_i(c) = c/i$ and the operation function $c = op_i(e) = i×e$, the *variables* $e, c$ are **extensive properties**, while the *parameter* $i$ is an **intensive property**, as shown in the [categorization of physical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties). That means, in the **subjective view** of the obop, its intent $i$ is kept invariant, while the extent $e$ varies directly with the conent $c$.
				- Otherwise, in the objective view, the total content of the Universe ([domain of discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse)) is considered fixed *c* = 1, hence the inverse variation of the two forms, intension *i* and abstract extension *e*: *1/i = e*. Here, the intent *i* gives intension, meaning, to the extent *e*, “*e* means *e times i*”, so that the abstract extension *e* can be used in place of the concrete extension *i⋅e*. As the obop *i* ranges over the content *c* to yield corresponding number *e*, *i* is known as the *index*, the *indicator* of the “current position” (the “here”), also the *interator* of the “current time” (the “now”).

														- Daniel5Ko replied:
															- The David Turner's paper gave Haskell codes of the exact definition of the Ackermann–Péter function.
															  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
															  From the paper:
															  ```haskell
															  ack 0 n = n+1
															  ack (m+1) 0 = ack m 1
															  ack (m+1) (n+1) = ack m (ack (m+1) n)
															  ```
															  #+END_QUOTE
															- Rewrite with functional `h` such that `f` = `ack m` and `h f` = `ack (m+1)`:
															  ```haskell
															  ack 0 = succ
															  ack (m+1) = h (ack m) where
															  	h f 0 = f 1
															  	h f (n+1) = f (h f n)
															  ```
															- Extracting `h` to Global Scope:
															  ```haskell
															  h :: (Int -> Int) -> (Int -> Int)
															  h f 0 = f 1
															  h f (n+1) = f (h f n)
															  
															  ack :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
															  ack 0 = succ
															  ack (m+1) = h (ack m)
															  ```
															- $ack(m+1) = h(ack(m)) = h(h(ack(m-1))) = ... = h^{m+1}(ack(0)) = h^{m+1}(succ)$ 
															  ⇒ $ack(m)$ is the m-th iterate of $h$ applied on $succ$.
															- And already said:
															  > By the way, definition in this style, even with a function called "iter", can be found on page 104 in [[5](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/sjt/TTFP/ttfp.pdf)]. Unfortunately it's not quite the same Ackermann function, and not just slightly shifted or something, but **utterly wrong**, since there `ack n m == m+1` for all nonnegative n m. A really bad typo! ;)
														- However, there was no update of the section `Definition and properties` in this occasion (July 2012), except some [minor changes of parenthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ackermann_function&diff=502596425&oldid=495513006).
													- on 27 December 2008, [r.e.s.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:R.e.s.) gave [interative version by Harvey Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ackermann_function#c-R.e.s.-2008-12-27T21:42:00.000Z-Jb-adder-2008-12-07T07:59:00.000Z)
													  > There's also a good case to be made for including one of the "streamlined" versions of the Ackermann function, especially the one appearing in [*Long Finite Sequences*](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.34.539) by Harvey Friedman: A1(n) = 2n, Ak+1(n) = AkAk...Ak(n)(1), where there are n Ak's in the iteration.
													- [primitive recursive vs. primitive recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ackermann_function#primitive_recursive_vs._primitive_recursion): Resolved: they are the same!
													- [Possible confusion between Ackermann's function and Friedman's function because both use the capital letter A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ackermann_function#Possible_confusion_between_Ackermann's_function_and_Friedman's_function_because_both_use_the_capital_letter_A)
												- My refactor
													- Split `History` to `Ackermann's original function φ(m,n,p)` and `other versions of Ackermann function`
													- `Definiton`: Move def of $φ(m,n,p)$ to `History`. Split Ackermann–Péter function to `Definition by recursion`, `Definition by iteration` (of function & of functional), and then `Definition by hyperoperation`.
													- Rephrase `Definition: as iterated 1-ary function` → `Definiton by interation` of both function $f = A(m)$ and functional $h(f) = h(A(m)) = A(m+1)$.
														- Iteration itself is a functional!
														- 1st order $f(n) = A(m,n)$
														- 2nd order $h(f)(n+1) = A(m+1)(n+1) = A(m)(A(m+1)(n)) = f(h(f)(n)) = f^{n+1}(h(f(0))) = f^{n+1}(f(1))$
															- This iteration of function $f$ is the [pure iteration form of primitive recursion](((682b333a-a938-4ccb-83d2-3afda66c938c))).
														- 3rd order $A(m+1) = h(A(m)) = h^{m+1}(A(0)) =  h^{m+1}(S)$
															- Pitfall: This iteration of functional $h$ is **not primitive** recursive function, due to the remaining arguments $n$ being applied last, not first like in the [pure iteration form of primitive recursion](((682b333a-a938-4ccb-83d2-3afda66c938c))).
															  $A(m,n) = h^m(S)(n) ≠ h^m(S(n))$
																- $h^m(S(n)) = S(n)$ simply!
													- Rephrase the abstract to state `Ackermann–Péter function is the *de facto* standard Ackermann function which is normally called "the Ackermann function"`.
								- Primitive recursive (PR): Bounded recurrence with `for` loops, including almost all computable functions studied in maths.

									  id:: 682b333a-a938-4ccb-83d2-3afda66c938c
									- Explicit long form of PR: $p(S(n), x) = f(n, p(n, x), x); \; p(0,x) = f_0(x)$, with successor function $S()$ over the iteration variable $n$ to generalize it beyond integers, and let $f()$ access both $n$ & $x$.
										- This is a bounded `for` loop over $n$ whose body is $f()$ with access to the global variable $x$.
								- P-recursive: Coefficients as polynomial functions of index k, solvable via generating/differential functions, often yielding special functions (e.g., factorial, Bessel functions). E.g.: $k!$ ([factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)), $H_k$ ([harmonic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_number), a special [harmonic progression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_progression_(mathematics))), ...

			- Differentiation: Every component is differentiated from the Trinion, hence equal to the Trinion in some aspect but not the whole Trinion.
				- The closed form (Circle) is the image of the Trinion but not the whole Trinion.
				- The total content (circular Arrow) is the body of the Trinion but not the whole Trinion.
				- The obop (Equal) is the representative of the Trinion but not the whole Trinion.
			- Partiality
			  id:: 6858b355-8966-4955-abe5-d6c126901cec
				- The Circle in the Trinion is not the whole Trinion, but just an abstract part of the whole, an image projected from the whole.
				- Abstract form (Circle) + content (Arrow) = concrete form [((66ab75a1-f4a0-4bab-a002-8e573546623a))] = total content [((667c0031-0a87-44c9-9e98-6d45893b095f))], but still missing the Equal, i.e. the obop, that looks at the Ω-thread and operates it.
				- The obop (Equal) is infinitely small compared to the total content, hence inherently partial relative to the Trinion. However, only through obop, can the whole Trinion be cognized, can the form be projected, and can the content be alive. That makes obop be an infinitely important point, a critical point, a ((6732cf13-5b1b-499d-80ec-4c5b407e9cc5)) singularity of the whole, hence inherently whole unto itself.
			- The Equal of the obop is tricky and contradictory: “Circle = Arrow” while they are apparently different!
				- Different things being equal is the nature of Circle, i.e. ((66f3e66a-8afb-4b20-bf85-111bc4aee09c)).
				- Contradiction is the nature of Arrow, i.e. ((66f3e588-9094-45af-9dff-2225c3ac39ab)).
					- Contradiction is discussed in [dialectical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism) via the statement “conflict is the driving force of change and transformation”.
				- Positively, Equal is the “unifier” in dynamic sense, but negatively, Equal is the “liar” in static sense. And i usually say “*the [Liar Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox) is the creator of all things!*”

				  id:: 685a97df-925a-44b4-bae6-235dd237f196
				  collapsed:: true
					- In current English standard, while there are two-sided relational constructs like “compare with”, “disagree with”, there's no such a parallel construct for difference like “differ with”.
						- In the current standard, people just use the directional construct “differ from (a base/reference)” in all cases.
						- In British English, [“different to”](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/different-from-different-to-or-different-than) is also used in place of “different from”.
						- The only symmetric construct of difference is “the difference between A and B”, but it's more analytical than relational.
					- In ((66537a44-f579-4fcc-a02b-2f32d0d409fc)), “diff from”, “diff to”, “difference between”, and the newly coined “diff [with]” have clearly distinct meanings.
						- ➡️ Unidirectional constructs
							- “A's difference from B” = “B's difference to A” is the `diff` relation from $B$ to $A$, i.e. $\overrightarrow{BA} = B → A = A - B$.
								- The prefered style of taking “difference” is the “from” form, i.e. $A - B$, while the prefered style of the `diff` relation is the “to” form, i.e. $B → A$.
							- “A differs from B” = “B differs to A” = “A is different from B” = “B is different to A” is the qualification of the `diff` relation from $B$ to $A$, i.e. $\overrightarrow{BA} ≠ 0 ⟺ A - B ≠ 0 ⟺ A ≠ B$.
						- 🔁 Symmetric constructs
							- “A's difference with B” = “B's difference with A” is the bidirectional `diff` relation between $B$ and $A$, i.e. $\overleftrightarrow{BA} = B ↔ A = (A - B) ∧ (B - A)$.
							- “A differs [with] B” = “B differs [with] A” = “A is different with B” = “B is different with A” is the qualification of the bidirectional `diff` relation between $B$ and $A$, i.e. $\overleftrightarrow{BA} ≠ 0 ⟺ (A - B ≠ 0) ∧ (B - A ≠ 0) ⟺ (A ≠ B) ∧ (B ≠ A)$.
								- Notes
									- Don't confuse this new construct with the non-relational expression of “difference due to some factor”, e.g. “She looks different *with this new dress*” = “*In this new dress*, she looks different”  or “He acts different *with alcohol*” = “Under the influence of alcohol, he acts different.”
									- This construct is parallel with similar constructs: “compare with”, the archaic [“differ with” = “disagree with”](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/differ), and the Vietnamese “khác với”.
							- “difference between A and B” = “difference between B and A” is the extent (magnitude) of bidirectional `diff` relation between $B$ and $A$, i.e. $BA = |\overleftrightarrow{BA}| = |B ↔ A| = (|A - B| + |B - A|)/2$.
						- 🧭 The direction of relations is crucial in Unïnfo, since both `sim` and `diff` relations are not symmetric by default.
							- Due to the ((66c88055-a994-4e59-a7dc-83f3331a6e1d)), ((685a9913-6bf4-41e4-89d1-5000a2b2f9d5)) nature of relation in Unïnfo, 
							  “A differs from B” doesn't mean “B differs from A”, and 
							  “A is similar to B” doesn't mean “B is similar to A”.
							- In Unïnfo, instead of static symmetric relations (like “distance between 2 points”), most of them are circular relations, like [cyclic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_order), e.g. $O_0 → O_1 → O_2 → ... → O_0$.
							- The circularity of relations gives rise to paradoxical characteristics, e.g.: 
							  > $O_0$ is very similar to $O_1$ but very different from $O_1$.
								- These paradoxes usually emerge in Quantum physics, like the [3-polarizer paradox](https://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/experiments/dirac_3-polarizers/).

			- Workflow
				- Always update hard-linked files from local repos, after any write operation on hard-linked files, e.g. `pull`, `checkout`, `reset`, etc.
				- When a hard-linked file must be updated from remote,
					- at remote repo, the update contents must be transported via the ((66519638-cf5d-409b-9b98-15acabf2268c)) which is not hard-linked; then
					- at local repo, these contents (blocks) will be moved to the hard-linked files.

					  > What is little-known generally is that the "U+" convention itself
					  was an ASCII-fied compromise for what the Unicode designers
					  *really* wanted to use for the Unicode hexadecimal prefix,
					  which was U+228E MULTISET UNION (whose glyph is a union sign
					  with a plus sign in it).
					- The `U-` prefix is also preserved for eight-digit hex code-points.

					     Backus-Naur form, is:
					     {U | u}[{+}xxxx | {-}xxxxxxxx] ([Unicode 14-](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode14.0.0/appA.pdf))
						- `U-` has been obsoleted by [Unicode 15](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/appA.pdf). See HTML version of this [Extended BNF in Unicode 16](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/core-spec/appendix-a/#G7157).

					- For notes to be published, i use quotation dash `―` to switch person, en-dash `–` for interruption, and em-dash `—` for source attribution – all are **space-separated** from the text.
					- Note about the mark connecting parts in a compound: In quick notes, i simply use hyphen, e.g. “Bose-Einstein condensate”, while in publishable notes, i use **en-dash without spaces**, e.g. “Bose–Einstein condensate”.

				- The theory was named “Universal Information” simply because the author ((66536578-c4d3-43f1-b35c-bf71120f0570)) is an information scientist. At that time, he saw the hierarchy of visible matter as: mass > energy > information. That means “*every __visible__ thing is information*”.
				- Later on, when studying the ((66ac41f1-de0c-48cb-a9b0-c30b0fe27c5d)) Theory, he discovered the invisible ((687f322c-2334-46e5-816b-57889e5c6b89)) underlying the visible ((66f7af1e-02d6-4c9b-b8f4-01a5ac6749d8))s (information, energy, mass, charges, ...).
				- That means, instead of “information”, the “universal substance underlying everything” is formally modeled as the  ((675c03d8-3185-41a8-9f98-e869fabec793)) and the ((66ab75a1-f4a0-4bab-a002-8e573546623a)), which capture not only information but also _the underlying **sustent** that carries information_.

			- ### Intrinsic Static
			  id:: 66f3e66a-8afb-4b20-bf85-111bc4aee09c
				- “Every arrow is composed of circles (⇴).” 
				  Just like a vehicle moving with its wheels, every change has its invariant(s), every motion has its law(s). The law of motion is invariant, the wheels of moving vehicle are invariant. Because they are invariants underlying the variants, they are called “intrinsic statics”.
					- ![Intrinsic static of arrow.png](../assets/Uniinfo/Intrinsic static of arrow.png)
				- “Every equal is in the shape of circle (⊜).”
				  The most familiar equality is that two objects having the same information: shape, appearance, measure, value, structure, class, type, image, extension, etc. The symmetry of equality, i.e. ⟪A = B⟫ ⇔ ⟪B = A⟫, shows a loop from A to B then back to A. Thus its shape is a circle.
					- ![Intrinsic static of equal - micro.png](../assets/Uniinfo/Intrinsic static of equal - micro.png)
					- The more subtle equality is that of the opposites, just like |-1234| = |+1234|. The opposites are “equal” because they are complement, together they comprise a whole which is represented by the Circle.

			- ### Intrinsic Dynamic
			  id:: 66f3e588-9094-45af-9dff-2225c3ac39ab
				- “Every circle is composed of arrows (⥁).”
				   Just like a spinning top, some object looks static because it's moving in circle, its motion is looping back, it's going back and forth (🗘).
					- ![Intrinsic dynamic of circle.gif](../assets/Uniinfo/Intrinsic dynamic of circle.gif){:width 50, :height 50}
				- “Every equal is in the shape of arrows (⇌).”
				  id:: 684f9517-8a24-4709-a62a-bd075acb9d2c
					- The balance between things is always a [dynamic equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_equilibrium) where the exchange between them cancels them out. For example, in mechanics, we have balance between force vectors, in chemistry, we have balance between reaction directions, etc.
					- The Equal is not a trivial equality of identical things, i.e. ⟪$A = A$⟫, but the equality between different things, e.g. ⟪$A = B$⟫.
						- Any meaningful equation ⟪$A = B$⟫ presumes that $A$ differs $B$ in some aspect, at least in their names.
						- In this sense, the Equal is not only a passive property but an active “equalizer” that makes different things equal, a “balancer” that balances the imbalance.
						- Here, the Equal is the one that brings differentiated things back together, to be one again, hence the “unification point” in the circle of ((667c008f-cd1f-4a6b-a9c8-d6efa1d8d342)).

			- ### Intrinsic Balance
			  id:: a95f4693-fe48-4a60-b1e3-5897a40efc5a
				- The macro balance of the whole (⊜)
				   For each “this” there always exists a “that” to counterbalance. If we cannot find the counterbalance, it's hidden in the meta world, e.g., when something is placed in an imbalanced position, there emerges a returning force as a meta to counterbalance. The parts can be imbalanced but the whole is always balanced. Another expression of the holistic balance is the [cyclic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_order), e.g., a < b < c < a ⟹ a ~ b ~ c. However, to a selful eye, the wholistic balance can be difficult to see because the whole contains not only the visible but also the invisible, not only the objects but also the metas. So, to see the whole's balance, we must use a holistic eye.
					- ![Intrinsic balance - macro.png](../assets/Uniinfo/Intrinsic balance - macro.png)
				- The micro balance of the selfless eye (⇌)
				   In stead of extending the view to the whole, when we reduce the self to zero, just look at the contact point, the incidence point, we see the contacting parties always balance each other.

And intensionally, the Trinion is the Universe itself. Then through [Unification](((c96a6d20-a0f6-48bd-9d70-9bc00b6b3c69))), intensionally, every being is just the Trinion itself.

				  collapsed:: true
					- The Sanskrit word “[śūnyatā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81)” and the Chinese characters “空”, “無” are usually translated to “emptiness” in English. But because such words e.g., “empty”, “void”, “nothing”, “zero”, “null”, “nil” have negative meaning, it's usually confused with [nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism) which is denied by both Buddhism and Taoism.

					- Thus, the term “vacantism” is used here to emphasise the _**usefulness** of the [vacancy](((66600918-9f92-4730-b056-c2cd87a742aa)))_, just like “vacant rooms” in hotel and “vacant hours” in life. Instead of “emptiness” and “nothingness”, the “vacancy” in “vacantism” shows availability and readiness: _there's always space waiting to be filled in_. Even if it's occupied, the occupation is temporary, and the occupation of one space generates vacancy in another space. And ultimately, “vacantism” means “the throne of the supreme being is vacant – not to be claimed and possessed by a [transcendent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_(religion)) & [pre-existing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-existence) one, and not for anyone to cling to.”
						- The usefulness of vacancy is stated in Tao Te Ching, Chapter 11:

						  {{embed ((684f9517-afac-49ba-97e3-b88529d74b24))}}
						- About the “vacant throne”: In the Buddhist sutta “[The Root of all things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C5%ABlapariy%C4%81ya_Sutta)” ([Mūlapariyāya Sutta](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN1.html)), the [attachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up%C4%81d%C4%81na) to any kind of primal root is uprooted by [arahants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat) and [Tathāgatas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tathāgata), whether it is the “root-nature” ([Mula-Prakriti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakriti#Samkhya)), the “primal matter” or “First Principle” ([Pradhana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pradhana)), the “primal conciousness” or “Supreme Being” ([Purusha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purusha)), or even the “unbinding, extinguished state” ([nibbāna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana)) itself.
						  id:: 68536bc0-f6ec-4595-8629-2a45d6bf713e
					- Note that vacantism does not deny the presence of a supreme being, esp. an [immanent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanence) one. The “throne of the supreme being” is said to be *vacant* not because there can be no such being, but because no fixed being can be entitled to that throne by default, to own it inherently, and to occupy it exclusively permanently.
					  id:: 684f9517-22fd-4695-b398-f142dca8a8d8
						- This vacancy represents **[non-attachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonattachment_(philosophy)) to metaphysical absolutism**. It keeps the throne **open** for whoever or whatever rising through context and relation to fulfill that role, to sit there temporarily.
					- Historically, the term “vacantism” was coined due to the lack of correspondent English term for the Vietnamese term “vô nguyên” (Chinese “無元”) in the chain “trialism” (vi. “tam nguyên”) → “dualism” (vi. “nhị nguyên”) → “monism” (vi. “nhất nguyên”) → “???-ism” (vi. “vô nguyên”) when discussing about [ontological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology) [categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Categories). Actually, at first “vô nguyên” was translated to “emptism” in the note “[Mọi thứ đều có Ba, để Ba sinh ra mọi thứ](http://creatzynotes.blogspot.com/2020/11/ba-sinh-moi-thu-moi-thu-sinh-ba.html)”, but then “vacantism” was chosen when editing this document of Trinion.

					  id:: 6852abe7-46f7-4e61-9162-ce1311f717af
						- The original meaning of ((66f3ed94-4f20-4166-8e9b-2e8ba53aaad2)) is simply “**no first**” or “no prime” (無元), because in ((66537a44-f579-4fcc-a02b-2f32d0d409fc)), every concrete thing is circular, thus the whole Universe is circular and nothing can be absolutely “the first”.
							- In the 1926 book *Philosophy of No First Principle* ([無元哲學](Philosophy-NoFirstPrinciple_無元哲學_CADAL07002676.djvu.pdf)) by 朱謙之 (Zhu Qianzhi, Chu Khiêm Chi) [on Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CADAL07002676_%E7%84%A1%E5%85%83%E5%93%B2%E5%AD%B8_%EF%BC%88%E5%93%B2%E5%AD%B8%EF%BC%89.djvu), Zhu situates “無元” as a critical stance against foundationalism.

						- Next to “無元” is [“無原”](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%84%A1%E5%8E%9F/927272) (**no origin**), meaning “unfathomable origin”, which is often found in Chinese ancient philosophical texts and literary works. The term can be traced back to the Han Dynasty classic 淮南子 ([Huainanzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huainanzi), [Hoài Nam Tử](https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho%C3%A0i_Nam_t%E1%BB%AD)), which explains the inexhaustibility of the origin of things through classic expressions such as “轉于無原” (“turning to no origin”, “chuyển vu vô nguyên”, “quay về vô nguyên”).
							- Note: Don't confuse “無原” with the modern term “無原由” (“no reason” / “unjustified”) in administrative/legal contexts.
						- And the last is “no source” (無源), a modern technical term meaning [“passive device”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_component#Passive_components), i.e., a device that does not require its own power supply (e.g., resistors, transformers), as well as an ancient philosophical term used in commentary on Tao Te Ching.

								- The relation between the “head” 元 and the “root” 原 refects the similarity between the animal's head with the plant's root, as shown in biology from [Darwin's “root-brain” hypothesis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2819436/) to [modern researches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_intelligence).

				- “Trinion” = “Tri-” + “union” is the union of the three components. This puts more emphasis on _the unity of the three_, compared to other triads like the ((66b1cfa4-e22c-4424-bf19-a6ce4649da77)). This meaning is very much similar to [the “Holy Trinity”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity) in theism, where “Trinity” may be considered as “Tri-” + “unity”.
				- In the course of finding a term not to be confused with the “Holy Trinity”, the “Triad” or simply the “Three” have been considered. But then the term “Trinion” was coined to reflect the harmony of both [the Differentiation](((1a22a090-6786-4114-8aad-35b122783bff))) and [the Unification](((c96a6d20-a0f6-48bd-9d70-9bc00b6b3c69))) as the dynamic of [the Existence](((66f3d644-782c-4f33-bd5c-db6e0a2d447a))) which is not only a “[pre-existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-existence)”.
				- And the Trinion can also be considered as the composit of layers of components as shown by the onion, which itself has [a Roman root meaning “one”](https://www.etymonline.com/word/onion).
					- ![Trinion-onion.png](../assets/Uniinfo/Trinion-onion.png)

					- The theme of triads in Unïnfo reflects the natural triadic relations in philosophies from the East to the West: Taoism's “yin-yang-qi”, Hinduism's Trimurti, Celtic culture's triplism, Christianity's Trinity, as well as triples of [categories of being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_of_being#Hegel) from Plotinus to Kant, Hegel and Peirce.
			- Postulate vs axiom
			  id:: 66f3cf07-4be5-4a50-9d99-b190b60f6ffa
			  collapsed:: true
				- “Postulates” and “axioms” are both basic assumptions of a theory and are used as the foundation and starting points to build that theory upon. However, while “axioms” are statements taken to be self-evident, accepted to be “true obviously” without question nor controversy, as reflected in the adjective “axiomatic” and in axiomatic systems of mathematics, “postulates” are statements derived from our real-world experiences, like the five postulates of Euclid (in contrast with Euclid's five axioms), and like the principles of physics.
				- In particular, the three postulates of Unïnfo here are statements derived from the author's experience.
				- Hence, these postulates are not meant to be the “ultimate truth”, and the correspondent components are not meant to be the most fundamental [categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Categories) like in dualistic and plurualistic ontologies. These postulates are just proposed here to be the theory's starting points, which are open and will be revised again and again throughout the theory.
			- About “intrinsics”

			  collapsed:: true
				- Respectively corresponding with the three components Circle, Arrow and Equal, the three intrinsic properties _static_, _dynamic_ and _balance_ are so intrinsic that none of them can stand alone.
				- Here we use the adjective “intrinsic” to emphasize the other underlying properties of a component over the apparent property of that component, e.g. the “Intrinsic Static” and the “Intrinsic Dynamic” versus the apparent “Balance” of the Equal.
				- Historically, while the West (Europe) has a long tradition of philosophy based on the Static, i.e. “existence” via “form”, “category”, “essence”, “element”, the East (from Islamic world, India, to China) has a long tradition of philosophy based on the Dynamic, e.g. “anicca” (अनिच्च, en. “impermanence”), “saṅkhāra” (सङ्खार, en. “formation”), “xíng” (行, en. “phase of transformation”), “yi” (易, en. “change”).
					- About the Balance, both the West and the East had focused on the moral balance, e.g. the inscription “Nothing in excess” in the temple of Apollo at Delphi, the “middle way” in Buddhism, the “Doctrine of the Mean” (中庸, Zhōngyōng) in Confucianism. Then in modern science, the role of Balance has been shown to be universal via equations.

						- Let's go, don't get too engrossed in this place.
						- But haven’t we already reached our destination?! After all the time, effort, sweat, and even blood we've spent to get here, shouldn’t we enjoy the fruit of our labor instead of moving on, master?!
						- I've allowed you to enjoy it for a whole week. If you think it's not enough, you can stay and enjoy it. I'll go alone.
						- It's not about enjoyment. I followed you to reach liberation, not to seek pleasure. If I wanted to enjoy myself, I would have stayed in the city with all its pleasures instead of tiring myself out climbing the mountain with you.
						- If you still want liberation, follow me.
						- But why do we need to move on when we've reached the destination of liberation?
						- This is not the destination.
						- Clearly, back in the city, when I asked, “Where do we go to find freedom?” you pointed to this mountain.
						- At that time, the city’s buildings blocked the view, so I had to point to a tall mountain for you to see. But I meant that “the destination lies at the horizon.”
						- So we can never reach the destination 😮‍💨?!
						- We can.
						- Have you reached the destination, master?
						- I have.
						- You're lying! Back in the city, I never saw the horizon, so you could fool me. But now, after months of travel, I've seen for myself: The horizon is endless. The more we walk towards it, the further it moves away, so we can never truly touch it.
						- I didn't deceive you. I only spoke in a way you could see and understand. Before, I didn’t say “the destination is the horizon” because you hadn't yet seen and understood what the horizon is. Today, I'm not deceiving you, either. I only speak according to what you now see. Now, look straight ahead; do you see the horizon?
						- I see the horizon as a straight line in front of me, but it’s just an illusion; there’s no actual line!
						- I only asked if you see it or not!
						- Yes, I see it.
						- Now, look behind; do you see the horizon?
						- Yes, I do.
						- Look to both the left and right; do you see the horizon?
						- Enough! On this mountaintop 🗻, wherever I look, I see the horizon. Don’t ask such redundant questions!!!
						- If you've seen it, let's go!
						- Why move on if we'll never reach it?!!!
						- I've reached it, that's why I'm leading you. If you don't want to go, you can stay here.
						- Wait, master, you can't leave! You owe me an explanation of how you can reach that endless horizon!
						- I've reached it by bringing the horizon right beneath my feet.
						- 😮 How can it be possible...
						- I told you before that you wouldn't understand! It's only because you pushed me that I had to say it.

							- Nhưng tại sao phải đi tiếp khi chúng ta đã tới được đích giải thoát?
							- Đây không phải là đích.
							- Rõ ràng hồi ở trong thành phố, khi con hỏi “đi đâu để tìm được tự do” thì thầy đã chỉ tay về phía ngọn núi này mà.
							- Lúc đó trong thành phố bị nhà cửa che khuất tầm mắt nên ta phải chỉ ngọn núi cao để cho con thấy thôi, chứ thực ra ý ta muốn nói rằng “cái đích nằm ở chân trời”.
							- Vậy là không bao giờ tới được đích sao 😮‍💨?!
							- Tới được.
							- Vậy thầy đã tới đích chưa?
							- Ta tới rồi.
							- Thầy nói dối! Ngày xưa trong thành phố con chưa thấy chân trời bao giờ thì thầy còn có thể lừa con được, chứ mấy tháng nay đi ra ngoài thì con đã chứng thực rồi: Chân trời là vô tận, mình càng đi tới bao nhiêu thì nó càng lùi về xa bấy nhiêu, nên không thể nào chạm được tới chân trời đâu.
							- Ta không lừa con, ta chỉ nói theo những gì con có thể thấy và hiểu được. Ngày trước ta không nói “đích là chân trời” vì lúc đó con chưa thấy và hiểu rõ chân trời là gì. Hôm nay ta cũng không lừa con, ta chỉ nói theo những gì con đang thấy mà thôi. Này, nhìn thẳng về trước, con có thấy chân trời không?
							- Con thấy chân trời như một đường thẳng trước mặt, nhưng đó chỉ là ảo giác, thực ra không có đường đó!
							- Ta chỉ hỏi có thấy hay không?!
							- Dạ có thấy.
							- Giờ quay về phía sau, con có thấy chân trời không?
							- Dạ thấy.
							- Con nhìn cả trái lẫn phải đi xem có thấy chân trời không?
							- Thôi khỏi! Trên đỉnh núi 🗻 này thì dòm đâu chẳng thấy chân trời, thầy đừng hỏi những câu thừa thải như vậy nữa!!!
							- Thấy rồi thì đi thôi!
							- Đi chẳng bao giờ tới thì đi làm gì cơ chứ?!!!
							- Ta đã tới rồi nên mới dẫn con đi. Con không muốn đi thì cứ ở lại đây.
							- Khoan, thầy không được đi! Thầy còn nợ con lời giải thích làm sao thầy có thể tới được cái chân trời vô tận đó!
							- Ta tới được bằng cách kéo chân trời về ngay dưới chân ta.

						- Greed: The positive feelings (like, ease, happiness, etc.) *cannot get enough*, hence **lacking**, wanting, and greedy. Greed is the lack of positivity, hence negative (yin).
						- Aversion: The negative feelings (dislike, unease, sadness, etc.) *cannot be avoided*, hence **excess** of sensation, stressed and aversive. Aversion is the excess of negativity, hence positive (yang).
						- Delusion: The neutral feelings (balance, stable, etc.) create the notion that “this is **perfect**, this is permanent, this only is enough” which is *incorrect* due to [impermanence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence_(Buddhism)), hence illusion, delusion.
							- Immersion in this neutral feeling creates the core **intent of self** to be attached to, including all notions of self, ego, and possession.
							- The mismatch of this core self intent with reality generates the greedy intent of acquiring the positive feelings and aversive intent of avoiding negative feelings. That means delusion is the generator of both greed and aversion.
					- 3 poisons in sex

						- Initially, there is **greed**: a feeling of lacking the other side stimulates desire, leading one to rush toward the partner and pull the partner into oneself.
						- Near the peak, there is **aversion**: when energy has accumulated fully within, especially in men, there’s an urge to release it explosively (reaching climax). If interrupted at this stage, one feels irritated, frustrated, and restless, regardless of gender, due to excess Yang. Men tend to exhibit this aversion more clearly as anger, while women often experience it more subtly as inner restlessness.
						- After orgasm, there is **delusion**: when the two sides come together intensely and explode, Yin and Yang harmonize, resulting in satisfaction, fullness—neither lacking (greed) nor excessive (aversion)... but also no clear mind (delusion). Thus, one embraces that blissful feeling, holding it tightly in the heart while sleeping.
						- During this sleep, delusion reveals its nature of **ignorance** (stupidity): one is content with the pleasure and cares about nothing else, simply rolling over to sleep. Then, upon waking and opening the eyes to see and know, delusion manifests as infatuation, indulgence, obsession and attachment: having embraced that pleasure and embedded it deeply into the subconscious (during sleep), one now clings to it heavily, with everything one does aimed at recreating that pleasure without awareness.
						- In Vietnamese: Trong 1 cuộc làm tình thì cả 2 đều trải qua quy trình tham - sân - si:
						  collapsed:: true
							- ban đầu là tham: cảm giác thiếu thốn phần bên kia kích thích sự ham muốn, nên muốn lao vào đối phương và kéo đối phương vào mình;
							- khi lên cao trào là sân: khi năng lượng đã tích tụ đầy trong người, nhất là người nam, thì bị thôi thúc phải cho nó bùng nổ ra (lên đỉnh). Ai bị ngắt ngang ở đoạn này thì sẽ bị tức tối bực bội, bứt rứt đứng ngồi không yên do quá dương, bất kể nam nữ. Nam thì thường bị sân rõ hơn thành nóng giận, còn nữ thường nhẹ hơn thành bứt rứt trong người.
							- sau cực khoái là si: khi 2 bên xáp lại cực độ để bùng nổ xong thì âm dương hòa hợp, thỏa mãn, đầy đủ, không thiếu (tham) không thừa (sân)... nhưng cũng không thấy đường (si), nên ôm cái khoái cảm đó vào lòng bó chặt nó trong tâm mà ngủ.
							- Lúc ngủ này thì si thể hiện bản chất vô minh (ngu si), ta sướng là được rồi không cần quan tâm gì nữa hết, lăn ra ngủ. Nhưng sau đó, lúc thức dậy mở mắt ra để thấy biết thì si thể hiện ra ở chỗ "si mê": do mình đã ôm cái sướng đó cài sâu nó vào trong vô thức (lúc ngủ), nên giờ mình chấp nó một cách nặng nề, mọi thứ mình làm đều chỉ để tìm lại cái sướng đó mà không biết.

The karmic pleasures will be replaced by the new rewards of the these absorptions.
					- Anti-greed with static absorption
						- [**Reset**](((67445065-15b2-475e-a704-78f140d487af))) to break the “goal reaching” pattern and to put the attractive target (intent) aside.
						- **Retract to the belly** with ((669a5162-19e1-4c52-8888-ab7cbfe275ec)) for the mindbody to be full, stable, so not to be sucked into the black hole of greed. This is a kind of samatha meditation.
					- Anti-aversion with flow absorption
					  id:: 68594391-006a-4630-964a-4a54e916b97f
						- Use **breathworks** – ((668f5490-c223-4a8a-9cc4-0bd71af4c097)) & ((68773fad-d653-4536-87b5-d4b493753b41)) – to release momentum, relax contraction and clear blockage, in order to get rid of aversion.
					- Anti-delusion with conscious absorption
						- **Watch** out the 3 poisons, comtemplate their effects, observe the reality to avoid delusion.
						- **Observe** the intents instead of looking at the external objects & target.
							- This inward observation closes the ((667c0031-0a87-44c9-9e98-6d45893b095f)) of the bodymind to free it from karma and influences of the external world.
						- This is a kind of vipassana meditation to ((684f9517-f8fc-45a3-80c9-25eca00e4eda)) the bodymind.

							- The “fleeting” property reflects the dynamic nature of the content arrow, e.g., the rotors (digit wheels) rotating relative to the stators (digit windows) in a ((6846d92b-cc0c-4db5-8b1d-766ec5a0d823)).
						- Whether fleeting or lasting, the abstract forms are just images of content, hence **partial**, hence [impermanent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence).

					- From some messy content, the first insight of form apears when that content closes into a ((66ab675b-2778-4f51-80ad-20a8f6988691)) which is the conceived form, and this event is called ((670de10a-74a7-49e7-856f-b77b50f8e3c6)). That closed loop receives more content from its source (mother) and organizes its content into a ((66ab6f84-88ba-4660-b4b7-f6dcbdd58a4f)) circle which is the crystal form ready to be separated from its source. This process of crystallization is called ((66faa5f9-0b7a-49ca-a5f5-62eeba03ab2b)), and the separation from its source is the birth of the ((670de601-3ca8-4489-8b75-75ca0d9a74bc)).
					- After birth, the form learns and adapts to the environment by ((670e1e36-8929-4a91-8f29-95775c21988e))ing its crystal structure, i.e. pruning its structure of complete graph, and by [loading more contents](((670dee3b-4d37-4852-993c-bdb9cdd2c3bc))) from the outside onto its crystal form. Throughout its lifetime, the crystal form deforms more and more in interaction with other forms. This deformation is the deviatation from the roundness, the imbalance that makes its ((66c8772a-9b29-45b0-b169-2fa847333e02)) to rebalance by restoring force that pulls it back to the original roundness.
					- A multi-layered crystal form can bear distortion to the extent that an outer layer of ((670d0160-ee4c-4b5f-b95f-80b0c2f3825f)) is broken (sick). The inner layers will try to heal the the broken layer by closing it. Each healing crystallizes some content deeper into the core of the this crystal form as well as its components (gene). When the innermost layer is broken, the crystal form is dead, and its contents (components, children) are released to the world.
					- A death of a crystal form does end the form of the composite but does not end the forms of its components nor its children. The released components with their own crystal forms will continue to participate in the formation of new composites in the process of rebirth.
					- The crystal form of a composite is thus a ((667d16f8-206e-4a85-80f3-24c2aa1bf4ad)) to carry components of other kinds, to help them transform and crystallize content. It's also a producer to produce children of its own kind.

				- The ((66f7af1e-02d6-4c9b-b8f4-01a5ac6749d8)) is dimensionless (dimension cancelled by ratio), but still has two directions `+` and `-`.

					- As the scale factor of content (ratio between content and intent), extent can be thought of as a “scalar”, but we don't use the term “scalar” to avoid confusion.
						- Each [“scalar quantity” in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(physics)) additionally has a unit which is the informational dimension, hence not dimensionless.
						- [“Dimensionless quantity” in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionless_quantity) may be called “scalar” in Unïnfo, but we use the term “dimensionless” for clarity.
				- The mass (amount of content) is not only dimensionless but also nondirectional, a.k.a. “absolute value”.

This is also the [Japanese pronunciation](((6824530e-32ac-4c75-9db0-12b1dc40102c))) of “Lê”.

				- [!] My expression of "arrogance"
				  collapsed:: true
					- Even i've never thought that i'm better/higher than anyone else, my expression does show some trace of arrogance which has been fed back by my (close) friends. Is shows something is hidden deep inside my unconsciousness. Here i list some causes that i can reflect on this problem.
					- 1st, the **illusion of** ((66537674-6cf9-4459-8bea-7c1858c694a3))
					  id:: 669a58b9-422a-40d9-adcf-b2aade86c170
					  The (holistic) view from above shows me the way and makes me feel that "i've known the way already, it's just a piece of cake" and forget that it's just a "map" and the actual walking the way is much much harder with much more efforts.
						- I've called it by many names: the karma of theorist (theorist karma), the sickness of talent (talent sickness).
						- My karma of theorist also corrodes others' trust on me.
						  id:: 668f4faf-db30-497a-a271-b2bbf5264413
						- My karma of theorist is deep.... [inside my trousers 😄](https://www.facebook.com/lexuandinhct/posts/pfbid02kppLiTrw7mWPdp3V8bVLq6MvQDb3FNBaseh1znLspueCQrcC1esTKbsT4PCB8663l)

						- This illusion contributes greatly to ((669a58b9-1a52-4ad7-932a-9e45ecb9960e)).
					- 2nd, the **implosive attitude** of my inner self toward external forms as if i'm fighting for the abolition of these forms ("đả phá"). Even though i consider "all views are equal"... they are just "equal in theory" while in practice i have a hidden tendency to consider my "inner view through content" superior to the "external view through form" of others.
				- [!] The clash between internal work and external work
				  id:: 6677b986-ada2-4c73-8a11-980cdf9cb6d4
				  collapsed:: true
					- As i dive deep inside, it's hard to surface up to do external works, hence many delays in (official) works.
						- I'm hooked to the deep works in front of my eyes. This hook is the tool that helps me to concentrate and avoid distraction from surrounding environment.

							- Without distraction, it's easier for me to stay in the free & mindful state. But in the free state, it's also difficult for me to interact with external tools like note taking, speaking, writing, forming formula, etc.
							- This hook can be replaced with the [ujjayi breath](((66952126-bf33-40e1-a208-369df7aa9488))). Using the internal tool (breath) gives me more control than the external tool (external sink).
					- [!] When i interrupt the internal work, my self is fragmented, heavy, lack motivation to do anything.

							- The inertia/momentum of the internal work is too large to be changed (in direction) ⇒ delusion.
							- That large momentum + the need to change = overwhelmed, heavy resistance ⇒ aversion.
							- When such large momentum is forced to stop, leaving the void inside, the self is hungry ⇒ greed.
						- Solutions
							- [Refine](((67b541d0-f477-4c3a-b444-fb522c3fdc4f))) the self obop to a small circle.
								- Magnitude of the form is small ⇒ high curvature, easy to change direction
								- Small self leaves room in the bodymind for external requirements ⇒ keep from aversion
								- Other different directions can be seen ⇒ clear & wise, not ignorant
								- The small self is never empty ⇒ no greed
							- To take action, the small self must combine with peripheral circles in the bodymind to drive them.
								- These peripheral circles are automatic motors working in the trained programs (karmas).
							- The total amount of contents in the bodymind is still sufficient thanks to temporary connection with peripheral circles in the form of pairs of opposites.
								- The opposites [keep the bodymind fully occupied](((6784f2aa-357a-44ed-a8c6-5ed1b9c78b04))) to get rid of the hunger, the greed, the wanting.
								- The opposites keep the dynamic center close to the static center ⇒ the sight line is level and points at [the horizon](((67445223-9459-4aa9-b102-70c63943577b))).
								- When needed to change direction, some peripheral circles must be released to return to the static center (neutral mode, [point mort](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/point_mort)) before engaging in any other direction.
							- [Reset](((67445065-15b2-475e-a704-78f140d487af)))tability: Peripheral circles must be trained to be released easily.

							- This [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) is just a kind of distortion in perspective view (projective/inversive geometry): 1/∞ = 0.
							  collapsed:: true
								- Our view is always distorted so that the far end always look shorter. So, when the goal is clearly visible to us, we can't help seeing the distance to it is short even if it's at infinity, just like the Moon looks very close to us at the horizon like "just some arms away".
							- The opposite of near-miss effect is the goal-fog effect where we lose motivation to reach a very near goal due to the obscurity of that goal.

							- “Complete, finished, done, target reached, ...” are just illusions. Nothing is actually complete, any ((667d15c6-67c4-4998-a549-c8b3f9de3d60)) is just a helix or spiral which is projected onto the plane orthogonal to the direction of change/evolution.
							- The basic illustion is that “when the circle is completed, it ends, finishes, no more worry”, while actually it's just _the **beginning** of a new circle_, either at the same level or at “higher” level.
							- While the true ending, the true finish is the death, either bodily or mentally, we always try to reach the end of some “hard work” wishing to have an easier living, either on Earth or on Heaven, or at Nibbana (Nirvana). That's the basic illusion of both life & death.
								- The urge to finish is a manifestation of _the urge to die_ in the guise of life, either as an orgasm or an explosion.
									- While Freud described [death drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_drive) (Thanatos) as the opposite of sex drive (Eros), i see they are just two faces of the same coin with the same nature.

								- Just be mindful that we don't lose that momentum when we switch to other works, just put it down to be picked up later on.
								- The effort justification & sunk-cost fallacy: This is the push of the momentum of the past, which adds to the pull of the future "finish soon", constraining the subject to the rabbit hole of goal reaching.
							- The clearly visible **goal** of the future is the external form, which reflects the inner core, e.g. my ((681b3ad7-d1b0-4c06-a4ea-385a4a9314e0)), crystalized from karma of the past.
								- The clarity of the external goal shows that it's very large, like the Sun & Moon. This mirrors the internal (hidden) core which is hard and heavy, like the singularity of a black hole.
								- Just be mindful that although it's worth pursuing, it's still **very far**, i.e. [the goal is the horizon](((67445223-9459-4aa9-b102-70c63943577b))).

							  id:: 684f9517-b730-4cc1-9eb1-54bb81ed78c4
								- The tantric practice shows that both the accumulation of momentum and the "finish soon" effect require ignorance in the form of attachment to the external signal (sign of the goal).
								- Unmindfulness of the internal momentum makes it push us from behind and control us.
								- Unmindfulness of the illusion of the external signal makes it feel near outside while in fact it's near inside and very far outside. That's because the signal outside is just the image/shadow of the goal inside.

							- As a natural (innate) **psychonaut** since childhood, i engage in space-inspired imagination, holistic perception, natural meditation (later enhanced by techniques), and psychedelic experimentation.
							- This psychonautic journey is fueled by the [“holistic core”](((681b3ad7-d1b0-4c06-a4ea-385a4a9314e0))) deep inside, and then the overview vision of the journey brings the “overview effect” up to the surface.
							- While the “overview effect” brings various positive emotions and attitudes, it also creates the delusion of a perfect world due to the masking of all complexity and ugliness down there via abstraction. This delusion is a kind of cognitive bias called [halo effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect).

									- **Core**: This core is so hard and heavy, like the *singularity* of a black hole, that i see verything in this world is being pulled toward it, and all forces are returning force toward the core.
								- This core may be a mental fixation, the result of karma accumulated throughout space and time, and usually the central point of attachment.
								- This core is the internal form (intent), the perfect circle, the crystal self, the boss, the source of both my strengths and my weaknesses.
								- To be free, this core, as the hidden boss, should be detached!

								- **Sublimation**: In [psychological terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(psychology)#Jung), this is redirecting the core’s energy from perfectionist fixation to a liberated self-essence. In spiritual terms, it’s akin to dissolving karmic attachments to reveal the “true self”.
								- Even the singularity of a black hole can [evaporate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation#Black_hole_evaporation)! 😊

									- While the Self is mostly hidden (until full realization), the God-image is usually visible through symbols and figures. And the ego usually takes the visible God-image to be the image of the hidden Self, which may be wrong, prone to idealization and fixation.

									- [William Shatner: My Trip to Space Filled Me With ‘Overwhelming Sadness’](https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/william-shatner-space-boldly-go-excerpt-1235395113/)
									  > It was among the strongest feelings of **grief** I have ever encountered. The contrast between the vicious coldness of space and the warm nurturing of Earth below filled me with **overwhelming sadness**. Every day, we are confronted with the knowledge of further destruction of Earth at our hands: the extinction of animal species, of flora and fauna . . . things that took five billion years to evolve, and suddenly we will never see them again because of the interference of mankind. It filled me with **dread**. My trip to space was supposed to be a celebration; instead, it felt like a **funeral**.
								- Seeing Earth as a “tiny, fragile ball” or even a [pale blue dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot) can diminish personal concerns but also make individuals *feel __disconnected__ from everyday life*. Upon returning to Earth, the astronauts may struggle to reconcile their cosmic perspective, e.g. seeing borders as artificial, with mundane realities or societal divisions, e.g. borders, politics. This can lead to **frustration** or a sense of powerlessness on Earth, as shown by Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell's [“drag a politician to space”](https://osl8.life/blog/understanding-the-overview-effect/).
									- Edgar Mitchell:
									  > You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense **dissatisfaction** with the state of the world, and a **compulsion** to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, ‘Look at that, you son of a bitch.’
								- Early X-15 pilots, as well as 90% of pilots so far, reported a [“break-off phenomenon”](https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/1957-clark.pdf), a negative experience of profound **isolation and sadness** when viewing Earth from high altitudes.

										- Frank White (author of “The Overview Effect” book (1987))
										  > Many of the great wisdom traditions of the Earth have pointed to what we're calling the "Overview Effect". That is to say they have realized this unity, this oneness, of all lives on Earth, and of consciousness and awareness.
										- David Loy (philosopher)
										  > Within the Western tradition, I think it's quite new, and quite shocking, because there's been much more of a sense of separation. But if you look at other non-Western cultures, especially in Asia, the emphasis on those has always been on the realization that the self and the world are not separate from each other, that they're really interconnected: that the individual self and the species as a whole is a manifestation of the large whole.
										- Frank White
										  > As you go into your mind in a contemplative way, the sense of the living reality of the planet becomes obvious, you become more in tune with the natural world. This is very akin to the direct perception that the astronauts have, so it's no wonder that many people have likened the Overview Effect to a spiritual or meditative experience, although it's not exactly that. It's a cognitive shift, that very often can produce a kind of meditative experience.

				- In Logseq, ((665fe765-2bb7-4392-9140-10e187f0f208))
				- Some independent works, like [[Theme Demo]] , can be copied (manually).
				- But interlinked works are complicated:
					- Either we must copy the whole closure of linked works
					- Or we must prune "unnecessary" links.
			- It runs somehow slower and heavier than ((66535660-643e-471a-a332-8f2306c5494f)).
			- The right sidebar together with the main edit pane is a convenient way to do side-by-side 2-column working.

						- The arrow control of the expanded block should also be shown, in order to not confuse the reader of that expanded block (in a quick glance the arrow of the closed block above can be confused as the control of this expanded block).
						- However, Logseq theme does not distinguish between expanded block and an empty block (with no sub-items), calling both `.not-collapsed`.
						- So, i cancel this solution.

					  id:: 66680ac9-70a7-4648-acda-4caa887bd447
					- Then the next level of ref, like this ((66680ac9-70a7-4648-acda-4caa887bd447)), cannot stop at the intermediate block, but jump directly to the original block.
					  id:: 66680ada-076d-47c8-b827-91fae9c3d4a2
					- However the preview does show the both intermediate block and original block (overlaying): just hover this ((66680ac9-70a7-4648-acda-4caa887bd447)), don't click!
					- => Better behavior: Preview shows non-overlaying blocks and ask for level of links to jump when clicking the link.

											- Ref: [Regular expression to match balanced parentheses](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35271017/789095)
									- [Idealy](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#link-best-practices), link text should not contain brackets, and parentheses in link target should be esceped: `(` = `%28`, `)` = `%29`
										- E.g. This links to [{wiki} Parenthesis_(rhetoric)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenthesis_%28rhetoric%29)
										- Because any unmatched bracket/parenthesis will break the link sysntax with broken text displayed.
