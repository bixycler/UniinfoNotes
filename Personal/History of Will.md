[[Will LE]]'s [[personal history]]
- In possessive form like "Will's note", [the apostrophe `'` stands for](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/history-and-use-of-the-apostrophe) the "e" in the suffix "-es" of [genitive form](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/genitive) of noun in the [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English). ^apostrophe-in-possessive-form
	- Now I propose to use apostrophe to further omit the "s" in possessive form, so 
		- `Will/mind/conceptual/head` in file management = 
		- `Will.mind.conceptual.head` in programming =
		- "Will' mind' conceptual' head" in natural language!

- Thanks to Obsidian's core plugin "Unique note creator", I'm introduced to the very old method of [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) (card file, slip box) with the software [NoteCards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoteCards), from 1984, as the origin the modern [[wiki]].
